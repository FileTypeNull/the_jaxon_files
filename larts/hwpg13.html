<p class="body">
Last scene, Romeo went to ask Friar Lawrence if he could <span id="highlight">knead</span> himself with Juliet. Later in the morning, after the events of scene iii, Mercutio and Benvolio converse about Romeo's lust for Rosaline. Eventually, they gossip about the challenge Tybalt had sent to Romeo for a duel. Once <span id="highlight">belated</span> Romeo enters, he and Mercutio exchange sexual puns in an <span id="highlight">ostentatious</span> fashion. Soon after, the Nurse and Peter enter. The three Montagues make fun of the Nurse until Mercutio and Benvolio think that the Nurse is asking Romeo on a date. She almost goes <span id="highlight">berserk</span> at how saucy Mercutio is, as well as how Peter did nothing to stop them from tormenting her. Afterwords, the Nurse references how she will be watching Romeo because she knows about his affairs with Rosaline and he cannot <span id="highlight">delude</span> her (the nurse).
