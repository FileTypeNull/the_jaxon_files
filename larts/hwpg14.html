  <li>And for that offence</li>
  <li>Immediately we do exile him hence.</li>
  <li>I have an interest in your hate's proceeding</li>
  <li>My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;</li> 
  <li>But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine</li>
  <li>That you shall all repent the loss of mine.</li>
  <li>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;</li>
  <li>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.</li>
  <li>Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,</li>
  <li>Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.</li>
  <li>Bear hence this body and attend our will.</li>
  <li>Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</li>

<p class="header">Summary</p>
<p class="body">
I believe the Prince’s verdict is fair. My reasoning is because he had once stated that someone must pay the price for any disturbance in the peace. Because two of the three people fighting had died, the one person left was the victim of the punishment. The Prince was more lenient on Romeo’s punishment because he had not started the fight. If he had, he would have been executed. Instead, Romeo was exiled.

<p class="header">Analysis</p>
<p class="body">
The reason why the Prince speaks only in couplets is because this is the second time he has had to settle the quarrel between the Capulets and the Montagues.
