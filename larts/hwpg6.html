<p class="body">
The two different houses are equal in social class, so this story isn't about differences in social rank. Also, this prologue is a sonnet: three quatrains and a couplet, though the rhyming scheme seems a bit off. It says that scene takes place in Verona, which is known as the "City of Love" in Italy. At the beginning of the prologue, it says "CHORUS". This leads to the question, "Were the actors singing?" Why are the deaths of Romeo and Juliet fearful, as it states in the prologue? Why is an ancient grudge breaking into new mutiny? Didn't most people who went to the Globe act rowdy, as well as eat and drink while the play was being shown? If so, why does the chorus talk about 'patient ears'? In the play, the story (relative to the characters) took place over the course of about four days. However, the actual play (relative to the audience) was only about two hours, as stated by the chorus. When it says, "where civil blood makes civil hands unclean", does that mean that the mutiny was physical, like war? The prologue makes use of the word 'loin'. This word means "the region of the sexual organs, especially when regarded as the source of erotic or procreative power." If this is the case, then this story might be highly erotic and sexual. In Elizabethan Theater, the women/girls were portrayed by young boys around the age of eleven or twelve. If this is a romance story, wouldn't the older men be kissing little boys?
