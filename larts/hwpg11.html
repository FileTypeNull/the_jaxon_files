<p class="subtitle">Act II: Scene iii</p>
<p class="header">Summary</p>
<p class="body">
In order to understand Act II, scene iii, context from the previous scene is required. In the balcony scene, before Juliet goes inside, Romeo proposes to her. Juliet gives her consent, and that she will send a messenger at 9:00 in the morning. As Juliet goes inside, Romeo leaves and heads of for Friar Lawrence's place. There, we meet Friar Lawrence as he is tending his garden and comparing flowers to poison and medicine. Romeo, being a stalker, lets him speak instead of greeting him. Later, he tells Friar Lawrence about how he no longer loves Rosaline and now wants to marry a new woman. However, Friar Lawrence is reluctant because it isn't right to forget someone whom you loved so quickly and marry their replacement just as quickly. He eventually gives in to Romeo's pleading and he agrees to marry them.

<p class="header">Literary Terms</p>
<p class="body">
Friar Lawrence's soliloquy at the beginning of Act II, scene iii contains iambic pentameter. The rhyme scheme of the soliloquy is in couplet format as well. "Night's dank dew to dry" is alliteration. There also stage directions everywhere.
</p>
<p class="header">Analysis</p>
<p class="body">
The reason why the fact Friar Lawrence's soliloquy is to himself is because it foreshadows the events of later scenes. Poison and medicine, symbolizes life and death, and it could be either, and you must choose which, just as Romeo did.
