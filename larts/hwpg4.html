[<i>Enter Chorus.</i>]<br><b style="color: grey;">CHORUS.</b> Two households, both alike in dignity.<br>     In fair Verona, where we law our scene,<br>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny.<br>     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>From fourth the fatal loins of these foes<br>     A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;<br>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>     Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>The fearful passage of their death-marked love,<br>     And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,<br>     Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
