<p class="subtitle">Shakespearean Sonnet</p>
<p class="body">
There once was a fair knight holding a sword.<br>
He slayed a dragon with his own bare hands.<br>
His rank changed into that which is a lord,<br>
And everyone followed all his demands<br>
<br>
A wizard came into the town to say:<br>
"This town shall now be mine to sell and buy,<br>
If you, indeed, set forth into the day,<br>
I shall make actions in which you will die."<br>
<br>
The people were not happy, which was bad<br>
Because they started rioting to tell:<br>
"You can't do that to us, it's very sad;<br>
We can't believe you made us have to yell!"<br>
<br>
However, the wizard was very mad.<br>
The people died which was very bad.
