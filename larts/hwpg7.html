"Two households, both alike in dignity.
<br>
     In fair Verona, where we law our scene,
<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny.
<br>
     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
<br>
From fourth the fatal loins of these foes
<br>
     A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
<br>
     Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
<br>
The fearful passage of their death-marked love,
<br>
     And the continuance of their parents' rage,
<br>
Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
<br>
     Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,
<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend" (Prologue).

"O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br>
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes<br>
In shape no bigger than an agate stone<br>
On the forefinger of an alderman,<br>
Drawn with a team of little atomies<br>
Over men's noses as they lie asleep;<br>
Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,<br>
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;<br>
Her traces, of the smallest spider web;<br>
Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;<br>
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;<br>
Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,<br>
Not half so big as a round little worm<br>
Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid;<br>
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,<br>
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br>
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.<br>
And in this state she gallops night by night<br>
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;<br>
On courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight;<br>
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br>
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br>
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<br>
Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,<br>
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br>
And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail<br>
Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,<br>
Then dreams he of another benefice.<br>
Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,<br>
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br>
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon<br>
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<br>
And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two<br>
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br>
That plats the manes of horses in the night<br>
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,<br>
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.<br>
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br>
That presses them and learns them first to bear,<br>
Making them women of good carriage.<br>
This is she" (Act I, scene iv).
