      <br><br />
      While Ferdinand is falling in love with Miranda, Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo,
      and other shipwrecked lords search for him on another part of the island.
      Alonso is quite despondent and unreceptive to the good-natured Gonzalo's attempts to cheer him up.
      Gonzalo meets resistance from Antonio and Sebastian as well.
      These two childishly mock Gonzalo's suggestion that the island is a good place to be and
      that they are all lucky to have survived. Alonso finally brings the
      repartee to a halt when he bursts out at Gonzalo and openly expresses regret at having
      married away his daughter in Tunis. Francisco, a minor lord, pipes up at this point that
      he saw Ferdinand swimming valiantly after the wreck, but this does not comfort Alonso.
      Sebastian and Antonio continue to provide little help. Sebastian tells his brother that
      he is indeed to blame for Ferdinand's death&mdash;if he had not married his daughter to an African
      (rather than a European), none of this would have happened.
      <br><br />
      Gonzalo tells the lords that they are only making the situation worse and attempts to change the
      subject, discussing what he might do if he were the lord of the island.
      Antonio and Sebastian mock his utopian vision. Ariel then enters, playing "solemn music",
      and gradually all but Sebastian and Antonio fall asleep.
      Seeing the vulnerability of his sleeping companions, Antonio tries to persuade
      Sebastian to kill his brother. He rationalizes this scheme by explaining that
      Claribel, who is now Queen of Tunis, is too far from Naples to inherit the
      kingdom should her father die, and as a result, Sebastian would be the heir to the throne.
      Sebastian begins to warm to the idea, especially after Antonio tells him that usurping
      Prospero's dukedom was the best move he ever made.
      Sebastian wonders aloud whether he will be afflicted by conscience,
      but Antonio dismisses this out of hand. Sebastian is at last convinced,
      and the two men draw their swords. Sebastian, however, seems to have
      second thoughts at the last moment and stops. While he and Antonio confer,
      Ariel enters with music, singing in Gonzalo's ear that a conspiracy
      is under way and that he should
      <iln class="quo" title="Ariel">"Awake, awake!"</iln>
      <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 2.1.301)</iln>.
      Gonzalo wakes and shouts
      <iln class="quo" title="Gonzalo">"Preserve the King!"</iln>
      His exclamation wakes everyone else
      <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 2.1.303)</iln>. Sebastian quickly concocts a story
      about hearing a loud noise that caused him and Antonio to draw their swords.
      Gonzalo is obviously suspicious but does not challenge the lords.
      The group continues its search for Ferdinand.
