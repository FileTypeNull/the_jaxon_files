          Trinculo and Stephano are the last new characters to be introduced in the play.
          They act as comic foils to the main action, and will in later acts become specific parodies
          of Antonio and Sebastian. At this point, their role is to present comically some of the more
          serious issues in the play concerning Prospero and Caliban.

      <br><br />
      Caliban enters with a load of wood, and thunder sounds in the background.
      Caliban curses and describes the torments that Prospero's spirits subject him to:
      they pinch, bite, and prick him, especially when he curses.
      As he is thinking of these spirits, Caliban sees Trinculo and imagines him to be one of the spirits.
      Hoping to avoid pinching, he lies down and covers himself with his cloak.
      Trinculo hears the thunder and looks about for some cover from the storm.
      The only thing he sees is the cloak-covered Caliban on the ground.
      He is not so much repulsed by Caliban as curious. He cannot decide whether Caliban is a
      <iln class="quo" title="Trinculo">"man or a fish"</iln>
      <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 2.2.25)</iln>.
      He thinks of a time when he traveled to England and witnessed freak-shows there.
      Caliban, he thinks, would bring him a lot of money in England.
      Thunder sounds again and Trinculo decides that the best shelter in sight is beneath Caliban's cloak,
      and so he joins the man-monster there.
      <br><br />
      Stephano enters singing and drinking. He hears Caliban cry out to Trinculo,
      <iln class="quo" title="Caliban">"Do not torment me! O!"</iln>
      <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 2.2.57)</iln>.
      Hearing this and seeing the four legs sticking out from the cloak,
      Stephano thinks the two men are a four-legged monster with a fever.
      He decides to relieve this fever with a drink. Caliban continues to resist Trinculo,
      whom he still thinks is a spirit tormenting him. Trinculo recognizes Stephano's voice and says so.
      Stephano, of course, assumes for a moment that the monster has two heads,
      and he promises to pour liquor in both mouths. Trinculo now calls out to Stephano,
      and Stephano pulls his friend out from under the cloak.
      While the two men discuss how they arrived safely on shore,
      Caliban enjoys the liquor and begs to worship Stephano.
      The men take full advantage of Caliban's drunkenness, mocking him as a
      <iln class="quo" title="Trinculo">"most ridiculous monster"</iln>
      as he promises to lead them around and show them the isle
      <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 2.2.171)</iln>.
