        <li>
          <ln id="char">Boatswain</ln>
          <br />
          The Boatswain is described by Gonzalo as
          <iln class="quo" title="Gonzalo">"[one whose] complexion is perfect gallows"</iln>
          <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 1.1.30-31)</iln>.
          Gonzalo is implying that the Boatswain looks and acts like a dangerous criminal.
          Furthermore, the Boatswain is seen giving orders to the men on deck and telling those who arrived
          from below deck to leave, for they 
          <iln class="quo" title="Boatswain">"marr[ed] [their] labor"</iln>
          <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 1.1.13)</iln>.
          It is also quite obvious that most of the characters below deck are vexed by the Boatswain
          and find him <iln id="chr">rude, arrogant, and bossy</iln>.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <ln id="char">Sebastian</ln>
          <br />
          Sebastian is much like Antonio, in that he is quite <iln id="chr">ill-tempered</iln>.
          He is also considered <iln id="chr">impatient</iln>, as seen when he declares,
          <iln class="quo" title="Sebastian">"I am out of patience"</iln>
          <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 1.1.56)</iln>.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <ln id="char">Antonio</ln>
          <br />
          Antonio can be described as a very <iln id="chr">ill-tempered person</iln>.
          For instance, he repeatedly tells the Boatswain to die, such as when he exclaims,
          <iln class="quo" title="Antonio">"Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker"</iln>
          <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 1.1.44-45)</iln>.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <ln id="char">Gonzalo</ln>
          <br />
          Gonzalo is portrayed as a <iln id="chr">wise</iln> figure.
          He makes the conclusion that the Boatswain
          <iln class="quo" title="Gonzalo">"[will]be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it
            and gape at widest to glut him"</iln>
          <iln>(Shakespeare 1.1.60-61).</iln>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <span id="second-header">Summary=</span>
      <br><br />
      A violent storm rages around a small ship at sea.
      The master of the ship calls for his boatswain to rouse the mariners to action and prevent the ship from being run aground by the tempest.
      Chaos ensues.
      Some mariners enter, followed by a group of nobles comprised of Alonso, King of Naples, Sebastian, his brother, Antonio, Gonzalo, and others.
      As the Boatswain and his crew take in the topsail and the topmast, Alonso and his party are merely underfoot, and the Boatswain tells them to get below-decks.
      Gonzalo reminds the Boatswain that one of the passengers is of some importance, but the Boatswain is unmoved.
      He will do what he has to in order to save the ship, regardless of who is aboard.
      <br><br />
      The lords go belowdecks, and then, adding to the chaos of the scene,
      three of them&mdash;Sebastian, Antonio, and Gonzalo&mdash;enter again only four lines later.
      Sebastian and Antonio curse the Boatswain in his labors, masking their fear with profanity.
      Some mariners enter wet and crying, and only at this point does the audience learn the identity of the passengers on-board.
      Gonzalo orders the mariners to pray for the king and the prince.
      There is a strange noise&mdash;perhaps the sound of thunder, splitting wood, or roaring water&mdash;and the cry of mariners.
      Antonio, Sebastian, and Gonzalo, preparing to sink to a watery grave, go in search of the king.
