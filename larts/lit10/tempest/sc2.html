          <ln id="char">Miranda</ln>
          <br />
          Just under fifteen years old, Miranda is a
          <iln id="chr">gentle and compassionate</iln>, but also <iln id="chr">relatively passive</iln>, heroine.
          From her very first lines she displays a <iln id="chr">meek and emotional nature</iln>.
          <iln class="quo" title="Miranda">"O, I have suffered / With those that I saw suffer!"</iln> she says of the shipwreck
          <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 1.2.5-6)</iln>, and hearing Prospero's tale of their narrow escape from Milan, she says
          <iln class="quo" title="Miranda">"I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then, / Will cry it o'er again"</iln>
          <iln id="p-cit">(Shakespeare 1.2.133-134)</iln>.

          <ln id="char">Prospero</ln>
          <br />
          Prospero is one of Shakespeare's more enigmatic protagonists.
          He is a sympathetic character in that he was wronged by his usurping brother,
          but his absolute power over the other characters and his overwrought speeches make him
          <iln id="chr">difficult to like</iln>.
          In our first glimpse of him, he appears <iln id="chr">puffed up and self-important</iln>,
          and his repeated insistence that
          Miranda pay attention suggest that his story is boring her.
          Once Prospero moves on to a subject other than his absorption in the pursuit of knowledge,
          Miranda's attention is riveted.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <ln id="char">Caliban</ln>
          <br />
          Prospero's <iln id="chr">dark, earthy slave</iln>, frequently referred to as a
          <iln id="chr">monster</iln> by the other characters,
          Caliban is the son of a witch-hag and the only real native of the island to appear in the play.
          He is an extremely complex figure, and he mirrors or parodies several other characters in the play.
          In his first speech to Prospero, Caliban insists that Prospero stole the island from him.
          Through this speech, Caliban suggests that his situation is much the same as Prospero's,
          whose brother usurped his dukedom.
          On the other hand, Caliban's desire for sovereignty of the island mirrors the lust for power
          that led Antonio to overthrow Prospero.
          Caliban's conspiracy with Stephano and Trinculo to murder Prospero mirrors Antonio and
          Sebastian's plot against Alonso, as well as Antonio and Alonso's original conspiracy against Prospero.

          <ln id="char">Ariel</ln>
          <br />
          <b>Prospero's spirit helper</b>.
          Ariel's real gender and physical form are ambiguous.
          Rescued by Prospero from a long imprisonment at the hands of the witch Sycorax,
          Ariel is Prospero's servant until Prospero decides to release him.
          He is
          <iln id="chr">mischievous and ubiquitous</iln>,
          able to traverse the length of the island in an instant and to change shapes at will.
          He carries out virtually every task that Prospero needs accomplished in the play.

      <br><br />
      Prospero and Miranda stand on the shore of the island, having just witnessed the shipwreck.
      Miranda entreats her father to see that no one on-board comes to any harm.
      Prospero assures her that no one was harmed and tells her that it's time she learned who she is and where she comes from.
      Miranda seems curious, noting that Prospero has often started to tell her about herself but always stopped.
      However, once Prospero begins telling his tale, he asks her three times if she is listening to him.
      He tells her that he was once Duke of Milan and famous for his great intelligence.
      <br><br />
      Prospero explains that he gradually grew uninterested in politics, however, and turned his attention more and more to his studies,
      neglecting his duties as duke.
      This gave his brother Antonio an opportunity to act on his ambition.
      Working in concert with the King of Naples, Antonio usurped Prospero of his dukedom.
      Antonio arranged for the King of Naples to pay him an annual tribute and do him homage as duke.
      Later, the King of Naples helped Antonio raise an army to march on Milan, driving Prospero out.
      Prospero tells how he and Miranda escaped from death at the hands of the army in a barely-seaworthy boat prepared for
      them by his loyal subjects.
      Gonzalo, an honest Neapolitan, provided them with food and clothing, as well as books from Prospero's library.
      <br><br />
      Having brought Miranda up to date on how she arrived at their current home, Prospero explains that sheer good
      luck has brought his former enemies to the island.
      Miranda suddenly grows very sleepy, perhaps because Prospero charms her with his magic.
      When she is asleep, Prospero calls forth his spirit, Ariel.
      In his conversation with Ariel, we learn that Prospero and the spirit were responsible for the storm of Act 1, scene 1.
      Flying about the ship, Ariel acted as the wind, the thunder, and the lightning.
      When everyone except the crew had abandoned the ship, Ariel made sure, as Prospero had requested,
      that all were brought safely to shore but dispersed around the island. Ariel reports that the king's son is alone.
      He also tells Prospero that the mariners and Boatswain have been charmed to sleep in the ship, which has been brought safely to harbor.
      The rest of the fleet that was with the ship, believing it to have been destroyed by the storm, has headed safely back to Naples.
      <br><br />
      Prospero thanks Ariel for his service, and Ariel takes this moment to remind Prospero of his promise to take one year off
      of his agreed time of servitude if Ariel performs his services without complaint.
      Prospero does not take well to being reminded of his promises, and he chastises Ariel for his impudence.
      He reminds Ariel of where he came from and how Prospero rescued him.
      Ariel had been a servant of Sycorax, a witch banished from Algiers (Algeria) and sent to the island long ago.
      Ariel was too delicate a spirit to perform her horrible commands, so she imprisoned him in a cloven pine.
      She did not free him before she died, and he might have remained imprisoned forever had not Prospero arrived and rescued him.
      Reminding Ariel of this, Prospero threatens to imprison him for twelve years if he does not stop complaining.
      Ariel promises to be more polite. Prospero then gives him a new command: he must go make himself like a nymph of the sea and be invisible
      to all but Prospero. Ariel goes to do so, and Prospero, turning to Miranda's sleeping form,
      calls upon his daughter to awaken. She opens her eyes and, not realizing that she has been enchanted,
      says that the "strangeness" of Prospero's story caused her to fall asleep.
      <br><br />
      After Miranda is fully awake, Prospero suggests that they converse with their servant Caliban, the son of Sycorax.
      Caliban appears at Prospero's call and begins cursing.
      Prospero promises to punish him by giving him cramps at night, and Caliban responds by chiding Prospero for
      imprisoning him on the island that once belonged to him alone.
      He reminds Prospero that he showed him around when he first arrived.
      Prospero accuses Caliban of being ungrateful for all that he has taught and given him.
      He calls him a lying slave and reminds him of the effort he made to educate him.
      Caliban's hereditary nature, he continues, makes him unfit to live among civilized people and earns
      him his isolation on the island. Caliban, though, cleverly notes that he knows how to curse only because
      Prospero and Miranda taught him to speak.
      Prospero then sends him away, telling him to fetch more firewood and threatening him
      with more cramps and aches if he refuses.
      Caliban obeys him.
      <br><br />
      Ariel, playing music and singing, enters and leads in Ferdinand.
      Prospero tells Miranda to look upon Ferdinand, and Miranda, who has seen no humans in her
      life other than Prospero and Caliban, immediately falls in love.
      Ferdinand is similarly smitten and reveals his identity as the prince of Naples.
      Prospero is pleased that they are so taken with each other but decides that the two must not fall
      in love too quickly, and so he accuses Ferdinand of merely pretending to be the prince of Naples
      When he tells Ferdinand he is going to imprison him, Ferdinand draws his sword, but Prospero charms
      him so that he cannot move.
      Miranda attempts to persuade her father to have mercy, but he silences her harshly.
      This man, he tells her, is a mere Caliban compared to other men.
      He explains that she simply doesn't know any better because she has never seen any others.
      Prospero leads the charmed and helpless Ferdinand to his imprisonment.
      Secretly, he thanks the invisible Ariel for his help, sends him on another mysterious errand,
      and promises to free him soon.
