                        <h2>Tom Buchanan</h2>
                        <h3>Metaphor</h3>
                        Tom Buchanan is a red sword because of the personality traits and characteristics that
                        he constantly portrays throughout the novel. His metaphor, the <i>Sword of Buchanan</i>,
                        is red because Tom exhibits many 'red' character traits: intensity, arrogance, and aggressiveness.
                        This is why he is represented as a sword that "swing[s] violently at anyone in their path no matter the consequence"
                        (<i>Sword of Buchanan</i>). He feels no remorse for many of his brutish actions and brings destruction unto people
                        without care. This is seen when he tells George Wilson about Gatsby and then shows Nick how little he cared about
                        the incident regarding Gatsby's death.
                        Tom's metaphor is related to Daisy's metaphor, <i>Fay Armor</i>, as they are both used in combat.
                        Tom is a sword because he is violent and hurtful, and Daisy is elusive, cynical, and hides her true personality
                        under a suit of white armor. Moreover, his metaphor is connected to Gatsby's metaphor, <i>Gatsby's Heart</i>.
                        Gatsby's item is cracked because Tom's sword cut open Gatsby's dream of the future.
                        This symbolically represents how Tom indirectly killed Gatsby through Wilson, thus destroying Gatsby's
                        hopes for love and happiness with Daisy.
                        <h3>Quote</h3>
                        <i>"Tom would drift on forever seeking ... for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game"</i>
                        (Fitzgerald 6)
                        <br />
                        In the description of the <i>Sword of Buchanan</i>, it is stated that "the sword was much sharper [in the past,]
                        but [now] it has lost its edge with time" (<i>Sword of Buchanan</i>).
                        This relates to Tom's character as his career and life peaked in college as a well-known
                        football star. However, the quote from <i>The Great Gatsby</i> shows how, despite his fame fading away
                        with time, he still yearned for an adventure as vibrant and violent as his college days.
                        This is the reason for many of his actions in the novel, as he gets with Myrtle Wilson to
                        continue trying to live that great adventure he so desires.

                        <h2>Jordan Baker</h2>
                        <h3>Metaphor</h3>
                        Jordan Baker is represented as a stack of fake gold coins, <i>Baker's Coins</i>, because she is constantly
                        shown to glint with golden shoulders. This symbolizes her success as a golf player,
                        which allowed her to obtain great fame and prosperity. However, it is fake because
                        Jordan is known to be an excessive liar. She lies about everything as if it were habitual for her.
                        She does it to remove herself from conversing with Nick about why she did not care about Gatsby's death,
                        stating doubtfully that she was engaged to another man (Fitzgerald 177).
                        The fact that the coins are "gilded" shows that she hides her masculine, uncaring, lying persona
                        underneath the glittering glow that she emits to express how successful she has become.
                        Her relationship to the other characters is shown in her item's ability to be used as currency to buy
                        the other items. This is because she has connection to every major character in the story and serves
                        as a bridge between them. This connective aspect of her character can be seen when she tells
                        Nick about what Gatsby had said to her about Daisy.
                        <h3>Quote</h3>
                        <i>
                            "She was incurably dishonest ... [perhaps] she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young
                            in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world"
                            (Fitzgerald 58)
                        </i>
                        <br />
                        This quote is very representative of Jordan's character as it greatly explains her character.
                        Nick offers a reason for why Jordan lies is to feel advantageous over others, and she stays away
                        from witty men so they do not see the veil of lies she has put up around her. She masquerades in this
                        aura of deceit so that she can maintain a perfect, golden appearance as a successful person
                        that is both happy and prosperous. This explains why she enjoyed Nick's company until she realized
                        he was witty enough to seek the truth and uncover her gilded facade.

                        <h2>Daisy Fay-Buchanan</h2>
                        <h3>Metaphor</h3>
                        Daisy's metaphor, <i>Fay Armor</i>, expresses her desire to shield herself from any sort of impurity
                        and maintain a disguise of innocence. In the description of the item, it is said that
                        "[its] purpose was to protect its wearer from the feelings of guilt that might plague her"
                        (<i>Fay Armor</i>), since she had fled from New York after Gatsby's death with Tom.
                        The armor is a silvery-white because Daisy's color symbolism is white. This is because she
                        is consistently seen dressed in the color white. "White" symbolizes purity and honor, which
                        are two traits one would not use to represent Daisy's true personality: one that is cynical and evil.
                        Her metaphor's connection to other characters is that the last user of the armor, Daisy, used
                        Gatsby's sword to strike down Myrtle, which is a representation of how she had run
                        her over in his car. Furthermore, she and Tom are both displayed as items of war, because they are constantly
                        combatting themselves by attempting to appear as perfect, moral beings despite their terrible
                        personalities. This leads to them hiding from their problems by retreating back into their money
                        and letting others fix the problems they had caused (Fitzgerald 179).
                        This greatly contrasts from her outward appearance because Daisy wears a suit of armor
                        to conceal these aspects of her character from others.
                        <h3>Quote</h3>
                        <i>"Her voice is full of money"</i>
                        (Fitzgerald 120)
                        <br />
                        I chose this quote to represent Daisy the best because it shows how her entire being
                        is relative to her financial status. She has never had to work a day in her life
                        as she is from a family of very wealthy people. Thus, she has never known the
                        feeling of want and has always been well-provided. This is shown in how
                        she expects to get everything she wants, and when it doesn't work for her,
                        she goes crazy with denial to the point where she accidentally kills Myrtle.
                        However, she doesn't even stop to look back at what had happened as she felt the need
                        to maintain her belief that her world was perfect.

                        <h2>James Gatz</h2>
                        <h3>Metaphor</h3>
                        Jay Gatsby's metaphor is <i>Gatsby's Heart</i> because of his dreams for
                        love with Daisy. This is shown because the color green represents dreams, hopes,
                        and aspirations for the future, such as with the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.
                        The cracks in the item are from the destruction of his dream by Tom Buchanan's item,
                        <i>Sword of Buchanan</i>. The reason for why it is a heart is because he
                        had so much love for Daisy that his dreams ended up manipulating his vision of her.
                        Nick notes how Gatsby had fallen for his own representation of Daisy's persona despite
                        her inner character flaws. This hope for relationship with Daisy drives his entire
                        character throughout the novel and consumes his every action. This is seen
                        when he replaces all of his mansion staff with Wolfsheim's associates so that they
                        would not spill gossip about Gatsby having Daisy over at his house.
                        Furthermore, he had bought his house so that he could see Daisy's house on the other
                        side of his dock.
                        <h3>Quote</h3>
                        <i>
                            "If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
                            some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life"
                        </i>
                        (Fitzgerald 2)
                        <br />
                        This quote best reflects Gatsby's character because it points out both his flaws and highlights.
                        Nick uses the term "gestures" to show that, although Gatsby may appear successful,
                        it is just a projection of the image of success whether or not there may be any substance behind that image.
                        This projection is an ability he had learned from Dan Cody while on his yacht: to act the part even
                        if it isn't true. Moreover, his "heightened sensitivity" to people's aspirations of hope
                        because he himself is the most hopeful for the future.

                        <h2>Nick Carraway</h2>
                        <h3>Metaphor</h3>
                        Nick is symbolized through his item, <i>Carraway Glasses</i>, because of his unique talent
                        of seeing the truth through clear eyes. The glasses represent his ability to see things
                        clearly, and the blue color of the frames show how miserable and moody those secrets make him.
                        As the story progresses, Nick's feelings of anger and unhappiness grow as he realizes the truth of the
                        events surrounding him. Moreover, 'blue' is used often to describe feelings of unhappiness
                        or misery, such as how Michaelis and George Wilson were in a blue mood after Myrtle's death
                        (Fitzgerald 151). In the movie adaptation, Nick is in therapy due to his depression and raging
                        alcoholism following the events that transcribed in the novel. This proves that knowning the truth
                        can harm those who know it, and Nick's unique ability to uncover the meaning behind everything
                        due to his great tolerance is also his greatest weakness. 'Eyes' are also a heavy symbol in <i>The Great Gatsby</i>,
                        as they represent knowledge and insight into the events that transpire; hence, why I chose glasses to
                        represent Nick's character as he has great understanding of the motives and secrets of the others.
                        The metaphor's relationship to the others' is that Nick's item can be used to see through the false purity
                        that Daisy's <i>Fay Armor</i> radiates. Plus, the glasses can see the dull chinks in the <i>Sword of Buchanan</i>
                        as well as the cracks in <i>Gatsby's Heart</i>.

                        <i>
                            "I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs
                            of wild, unknown men"
                        </i>
                        (Fitzgerald 1)

                        This quote is the most important characterization of Nick throughout the entire novel.
                        It explains the reasoning behind why Gatsby tells Nick  his secrets and how Nick serves
                        his role as a narrator. His ability as a narrator is enhanced by his ability to be deemed trustworthy
                        be even those as mysterious as Gatsby. Furthermore, it foreshadows how many will see Nick
                        as someone like a politician or con-artist while he knows that he might be the most trustworthy
                        and honest person he had ever known. This quote also links to his growing misery as he gets
                        tossed into the plot of a story due to his connections and ability to serve as a vessel for
                        people's secrets that left him depressed (as expressed in the movie adaptation).
