                    Hello, and welcome to <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, the RPG!
                    What is an RPG, you ask? Well, an RPG is a role-playing game
                    which means that the players assume the roles of fictional characters
                    and act out their roles in the narrative as those characters.
                    It is your responsibility to make sure the narrative goes through its proper course
                    and ends in the correct manner! Why is <i>The Great Gatsby</i> an RPG?
                    Well, it is because the story progresses through the point of view of Nick Carraway, whose beliefs
                    and thoughts are internalized by the reader in a way similar to a role-playing game.
                    The readers feel the same way as the fictional character whose role they assume.
                    The characters of the story are symbolized by the different items in the shop, which
                    is where you purchase items to use as a means of progressing through the story.
                    The reason for why I chose to use these items to represent the characters is because
                    they seem to be all characters with unique pasts that aid in the progression
                    of the story, just like items in an RPG.
