     The government obtains and maintains power over the towns' people in "The Lottery".  <span id="claim">I believe that the government was able to gain this power by using fear to force the populous to change their traditions. It also educated the youth to believe that these changes were always in effect, as well as beneficial.</span> <span id="evidence">An example of fear is by killing people if they neither agree nor comply with the government's ideals.</span> <span id="analysis">One form of this forced compliance is when Tessie Hutchinson argued with Mr. Summers, so he had made <i>her</i> the lottery winner, resulting in her death.</span> <span id="evidence">One example of education of the young is how, in "The Lottery", children are eager to kill other people, even their own parents.</span> <span id="analysis">When Old Man Warner called the citizens of other villages "pack[s] of crazy fools", he means that the youth were not taught the traditions correctly by the government, leading to suspicion.</span> In conclusion, both youth education and fear were used as methods of forced compliance by the government in "The Lottery".
