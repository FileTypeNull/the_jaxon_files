<p class="header">Summary</p>
<p class="body">
After Prince Escalus' speech, Lord and Mrs. Montague ask Benvolio how the fighting had arisen. Benvolio responds with a biased truth; he told the truth, but explained it with more favoritism towards the Montagues. Afterward, they compare changes in Romeo's behavior; Romeo has been locking himself away from daylight and other people. When Benvolio asks him why he has such sorrow, Romeo replies that he is in love, but she does not love him back. This woman lives chaste, meaning she will never have sex, thus never having children. Benvolio states that there are many fine woman in the city of Verona, but Romeo believes that no woman could ever compare to this chaste woman. In Act II, we see that Count Paris is asking Lord Capulet if he should request Juliet's hand in marriage, but Lord Capulet counters with the fact that she is not even 14. Instead, the Lord suggests that Count Paris woo her over first, and he can get his first chance at a party tonight. He hands a list of names to one of his servants who cannot read, so the servant asks Romeo to read off the list for him. It is apparent that the woman Romeo loves, Rosaline, is going to the party. Benvolio suggests that this is the chance for Romeo to compare her to other women, but Romeo insists that no woman is fairer than she.

<p class="body">
Romeo, when describing his love for Rosaline, uses about 10 oxymorons. "O brawling love, O brawling hate, O anything, of nothing first created" (Act I, scene i). When Romeo describes Rosaline's beauty, the sentences he use are in iambic pentameter. In Act II, scene ii, Benvolio speaks with Romeo, and the first line he has in that scene is a quatrain with a couplet. When Montague says "all-cheering sun", he is using personification.

<p class="header">Analysis</p>
<p class="body">
The reason why Romeo uses oxymorons to describe his love for Rosaline is to compare his love to hate. These oxymorons represent the relationship because they use contradicting words, just as the relationship between Rosaline and Romeo is not mutual.
