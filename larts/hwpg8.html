<ol type="1">
  <li>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</li>
  <li>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,–</li>
  <li>Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,</li>
  <li>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</li>
  <li>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</li>
  <li>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</li>
  <li>Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,</li>
  <li>And here the sentence of your moved prince.</li>
  <li>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</li>
  <li>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</li>
  <li>Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets,</li>
  <li>And made Verona's ancient citizens</li>
  <li>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</li>
  <li>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</li>
  <li>Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate:</li>
  <li>If you ever disturb our streets again,</li>
  <li>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</li>

In line 3, Prince Escalus describes the men as beasts. This is a metaphor because he is comparing the fighters to malicious beasts. In line 7, Prince Escalus refers to the weapons as mistempered, which is a human characteristic. Thus, this is personification. In line 14, the use of a simile is evident. The first and last lines end with the word 'peace'. Prince Escalus describes these fights as 'airy', which means of no importance to others. In line 1, the use of the phrase "rebellious subjects" makes it an oxymoron. Isn't execution the exact opposite of a peaceful approach? Why are the citizens nonbelievers (profaners)?

In line 9, Prince Escalus makes use of the word 'airy'. The definition of airy is something, such as an argument, of no importance to other individuals. In the context of the sentence, the prince describes the two houses' quarrel as unimportant and unnecessary. In the sentence, the prince says "bred of an airy word", which means that the quarrel was created by a conversation or argument of no importance to the city. Basically, Prince Escalus is stating that the quarrel between the Montagues and Capulets is absolutely unimportant and he wants it to stop.
