<p class="subtitle">Who is Shakespeare?</p>
<p class="header">Interesting Fact 1:</p>
<p class="body">
There is documentary proof that Shakespeare was baptized on 26th April 1564, and scholars believe that, in keeping with the traditions of the time, he would have been baptized when he was three days old, meaning Shakespeare was probably born on April 23rd. However, as Shakespeare was born under the old Julian calendar, what was April 23rd during Shakespeare’s life would actually be May 3rd according to today’s Gregorian calendar.

Shakespeare’s parents were John and Mary Shakespeare (nee Arden). John came to Stratford from Snitterfield before 1532 as an apprentice glover and tanner of leathers. He prospered and began to deal in farm products and wool before being elected to a multitude of civic positions.
