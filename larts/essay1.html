     Since any sort of governmental structure was created, it has been a fact that it keeps secrets from the population. This can be seen in Hitler’s rise to power and how he tricked the German population into following his every command. To add on this, the United States also hid the fact that, even though the people could vote for representatives in the House, the Senate had all the actual power. Both of these situations can be combined into one large topic. The novel <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> explores these totalitarian situations in a dystopian society where the government holds all of the power in the country, building upon them and adding to them. In Ray Bradbury’s <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, the government obtains and maintains power by controlling individual thought and using censored media to replace books.

     The government obtains and maintains power in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> by discouraging individual thought. It manipulates the laws to where each person only participates in activities which have been decreed viable by the government. Because of books encouraging individual thought, the government declared the actions of either owning or reading a book illegal, thus controlling individual thought in the process. This can explain how, in order to maintain its power, the government removed any sources of individual thought, such as books. Clarisse told Montag, “’… I don't think it's social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you? An hour of TV class, an hour of basketball or baseball or running, another hour of transcription history or painting pictures, and more sports, but do you know, we never ask questions, or at least most don't; they just run the answers at you, [with] us sitting there for four more hours of film...’” (Bradbury 27). In this society, the government forces every student to follow the same schedule. Thus, children never learn how to think individually. This relates to the removal of individual thought due to a scarcity of different and unique minds in children.  In addition, these schedules affect how each child will behave whilst they are an adult, which is relatively similar. Clarisse had also said, “’Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?' … 'Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames’” (Bradbury 6). The government exploits the lack of written history and uses that unknown knowledge to change history, warping the minds of the population as a result. Her uncle, however, is capable of retaining this information because memories cannot be burned, unlike a book. This is how Clarisse knew that firemen used to put out fires instead of starting them; her uncle taught her how to think for herself and standout, unlike the “normal” children who go to school and despise thinking individually. To summarize, a person can infer that controlling individual thought is a way the government was able to gain totalitarian power.

     The government is able to obtain and maintain power by replacing books with governmentally censored media. The elimination of books and replacement of televisions allows the government to modify the truth and change the outcome of an event. One example is when the police reports that Montag has committed murder and other crimes against the State. The government is able to censor this information by describing what “other crimes” he had committed. This also shows how the government can persuade the population with minimal evidence and little effort. Another example could be the fact that the Hound loses Montag across the river, and the news decides to film them killing a fake Montag, and then reporting that they have successfully killed “Montag”. The government hides the fact that they had lost Montag at the river, lying to the populous in order to maintain control. This can relate to censorship due to how they changed the face of the innocent bystander to a blur, censoring the face to the point where it could be anyone. Concluding, a person is able to assume that the removal of books and usage of censored media is a way the government is able to maintain their influence over the population.

     In essence, the government was able to gain and maintain its power through the manipulation of individuals coupled with the removal of books. To control individual thought, the government forced everyone to comply or face punishment. By removing books, the government is able to remove any source of credible history and replace it with censored media. The media is also able to change the outcome events, as seen with the death of fake Montag. Understanding these qualities in Ray Bradbury’s <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> allows individuals to make connections between the real world and the story’s dystopian society.
