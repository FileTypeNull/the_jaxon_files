     In the short story, "The Lottery", the government seemingly obtains and maintains their power by means of fear, and of youth education. Forced compliance by fear could be executing people if they choose to disagree with the government's ideals. An example of this is when Tessie begins to question the lottery by saying that "it isn't fair ... it isn't right."  This causes Mrs. Hutchinson to become the person who wins the lottery. Education of the young in "The Lottery" can be explained by how children are eager to kill other people, even their own parents. An example of this is when "... someone gave little Davy Hutchinson [a] few pebbles." This allows me to infer that children are taught that these lotteries are necessary when they are young. In conclusion, both youth education and fear were used as methods of forced compliance by the government in "The Lottery".
