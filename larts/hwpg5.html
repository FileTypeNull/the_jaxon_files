<p class="body">
Daniel, a high school junior, woke up and saw the sun near its highest point in the sky. When he saw the time, he jumped out of bed and <span id="highlight">hone</span>d his vision on the clock. It was 11:28 in the morning! He cursed and ran into his bathroom, getting dressed and washed up for school. Daniel started wishing he hadn't taken that <span id="highlight">opiate</span> last night to help him fall asleep. He drowsily ran down the stairs, took a muffin from the kitchen counter, got in his car, and drove to school. Daniel's <span id="highlight">antiquated</span> car puffed and moaned all the way to school, eventually letting out a small hiss when he turned off the ignition. He <span id="highlight">gorge</span>d his muffin down and ran into the building, rushing toward his 4<sup>th</sup> period class. On the way, he saw a vending machine and decided he could use a soft drink. However, this act was wasting time! This caused lackadaisical Daniel to miss his 4<sup>th</sup> period class, and having to deal with making up his Math Test. At this point, he was feeling quite <span id="highlight">demented</span> after that mishap.
