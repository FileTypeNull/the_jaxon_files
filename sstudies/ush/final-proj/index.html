                    In 1848, gold was discovered in Sutter Creek near Coloma, California by James W. Marshall.
                    This led to the California Gold Rush of 1848 to 1855; however, news about the mineral's
                    discovery didn't reach the East until around 1849 which led to those who travelled to
                    California in search of gold being nicknamed '49ers.

                   It was written by proslavery reporters after the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 was passed, overturning the
                   Missouri Compromise that declared that no states above the 32nd parallel could have slaves.

                    In 1820, the Missouri Compromise was established, setting up the 32nd parallel which separated
                    the free states from the slave states. It also required that there be an equal amount of
                    slave states and free states, meaning that two states must be admitted together to keep this equilibrium.
                    It resulted in extreme sectionist tension between the North and South throughout the antebellum period.
                    Inevitably, the Missouri Compromise led to the Civil War because it determined a physical boundary
                    between the North and South. Missouri was meant to be the only exception to the Missouri Compromise,
                    but it was overturned in 1854 with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

                    On April 6th, 1846, Dred Scott filed a lawsuit against Irene Emerson, his owner, for unlawful ownership.
                    Because his old master had died while he was in free territory, he believed that by Missouri
                    statutes he was no longer to be considered a slave. However, Irene, his master's wife, picked up Scott
                    and took him back to St. Louis despite his claims at his new status as a freedman
                    Unfortunately, in 1857, the case made its way to the Supreme Court, where they declared that African Americans
                    were not citizens and were protected under the right of property to their master's families.
                    This heightened sectionist tension between the North and South due to its controversial
                    decision that devastated the attempts of abolitionists to attack slavery as immoral due
                    to the now illegitimate citizenship of any freedmen.

                    After the war with Mexico in 1848, the United States gained a massive amount of territory from Mexico known as the Mexican cession.
                    This new land included parts of modern New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and Colorado.
                    Consequently, the question over the potential status of slavery within these territories led to tension
                    within Congress that was supposedly resolved by Henry Clay's Compromise of 1850. However, this compromise
                    only added further to the sectionist conflict that led to the Civil War due to its provisions.
                    One such provision was the Fugitive Slave Act, which forced the North to participate in the returning of slaves to the South.
                    Between 1850 and 1860, nearly 343 African Americans appeared before federal commissioners, and 332 of those were returned to the South.

                    The 1860 election was significant in that the first Republican president had been elected: Abraham Lincoln.
                    This gravely upset the South, since Lincoln's name did not even appear on their ballot due to
                    the legislature's distaste for such a candidate. Lincoln was not an abolitionist, but a free soiler; thus,
                    he wanted to prevent the expansion of slavery into further territory. As a result, the South feared
                    that the sequence of evewnts that followed would lead to the end of slavery&mdash;in other words,
                    their "right" to property would be revoked. Inevitably, this led to the secession of the South
                    from the United States and the formation of the Confederacy, inciting what would eventually become
                    the American Civil War.

                    Andrew Jackson, in 1832, signed into law a tariff that lowered the burden of the
                    1828 tariff but not significantly enough to appease the South. The South
                    wanted smaller tariffs because they made a profit off of trade
                    with Europe. In response, South Carolina retaliated by declaring the
                    tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and threatening secession.
                    The sitting Vice President, John C. Calhoun, quit his office in order
                    to defend the position of South Carolina. This caused great tension between
                    the North and South regarding the issue, and threatened the dissolution of the
                    Union. Luckily, Henry Clay resolved the issue temporarily with the Compromise
                    Tariff of 1833, which lowered the tariffs significantly and voided the previous two.

                    The Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 was the first women's rights convention in America's history.
                    At the convention were several prominent abolitionists, women's rights activists, and others.
                    Unfortunately, Frederick Douglass was the sole African American attendee. At the convention, the
                    Declaration of Sentiments&mdash;a callback to the Declaration of Independence&mdash;was created,
                    stating the tribulations of women and slaves in the United States and how prejudice against
                    any one group is unlawful and unjust. Although there was little success in the
                    convention other than increasing awareness of issues, the Seneca Falls Convention
                    represents a landmark in American history for its celebration of women's activism
                    and participation in society during the Antebellum era.
