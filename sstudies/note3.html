<span id="second-header">The Policymaking System</span>
<br><br>
• It is through the <b>policymaking system</b> that our government responds to the priorities of its people
<br><br>
• <span id="third-header">People Shape Policy</span>
<br>
- The policymaking system begins with people
<br>
- All Americans have interests, problems, and concerns that are touched on by public policy
<br>
- People have numerous avenues for participation, such as voting for candidates who represent their opinions, joining political parties, posting messages to internet chat groups, and forming <i>interest groups</i>
<br>
- This way, the people's concerns enter the <b>linkage institutions</b> of the policymaking system
<br>
- All these institutions help to shape the government's <b>policy agenda</b>, the issues that attract the serious attention of public officials and other people actively involved in politics at a given time
<br>
- A <b>political issue</b> is the result of people disagreeing about a problem  or about the public policy needed to fix it
<br>
- Policymakers stand at the core of the system, working within the three <b>policymaking institutions</b> established by the U.S. Constitution:
<br><br>
1. Congress
<br>
2. The Presidency
<br>
3. The Courts
<br><br>
- Policymakers scan the issues on the policy agenda, select those they consider important, and make <b>policies</b> to address them
<br><br>
• <span id="third-header">Policies Impact People</span>
<br>
- The policymaking system both starts and ends with the people
