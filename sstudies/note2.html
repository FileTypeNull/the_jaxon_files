• <b>Politics</b> determines whom we select as our governmental leaders and what policies these leaders pursue. Political scientists often cite Harold D. Lasswell's famous definition of politics: "Who gets what, when, and how." It is one of the briefest and most useful definitions covers a lot of ground (office politics, sorority politics, and so on) in which political scientists are generally not interested. They are interested primarily in politics related to governmental decision making.<br>• The media usually focus on the <i>who</i> of politics. At a minimum, this includes voters, candidates, groups, and parties. <i>What</i> refers to the substance of politics and government—benefits, such as medical care for the elderly, and burdens, such as new taxes. <i>How</i> refers to the ways in which people participate in politics. People get what they want through voting, supporting, compromising, lobbying, and so forth. In this sense, government and politics involve winners and losers. Behind every arcane tax provision or item in an appropriations bill, there are real people getting something or getting something taken away.<br>• The ways in which people get involved in politics make up their <b>political participation</b>. Many people judge the health of a government by how widespread political participation is. America does quite poorly when judged by its voter turnout, which is one of the lowest in the world. Low voter turnout has an effect on who holds political power. Because so many people do not show up at polls, voters are a distorted sample of the public as a whole. Groups with a high turnout rate, such as young people, lack political clout.<br>• Voting is only one form of political participation. For a few Americans, politics is a vocation: they run for office, and some even earn their livelihood from holding political office. In addition, there are many Americans who treat politics as critical to their interests. Many of these people are members of <b>single-issue groups</b>—groups so concerned with one issue that members often cast their votes on the basis of that issue only, ignoring a politician's stand on everything else. Groups of activists dedicated either to outlawing abortion or to preserving abortion rights are good examples of single-issue groups.
