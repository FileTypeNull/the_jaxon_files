<span id="second-header">Demand</span>
<br><br />
<span id="hlight-y">Demand</span> is the desire for a product dependent upon its quantity and price.
The <b>Law of Demand</b> states that (keeping all other things equal) as the price falls, the quantity demanded rises.
As the price rises, the quantity demanded falls. This is an inverse relationship which can be seen in the graph below
that is usually used to represent the market demand. Market demand is the representation of the demands of multiple individuals
(individual demand is also called quantity demanded).

Changes in demand:
<br>
<ul class="custom" id="hyphen">
    <li>A change in quantity demanded results in a different price along the same curve</li>
    <li>A change in market demand results in the same price on a different curve</li>
</ul>
<br />
<img class="img" src="images/demand-curve.png">
<br><br />
Demand is influenced by various <span id="hlight-b">determinants</span>:
<br>
<ul class="custom" id="open-circle">
    <li>Buyers' tastes</li>
    <li>Number of buyers</li>
    <li>Income</li>
    <li>Prices of related goods</li>
    <li>Consumer expectations</li>
</ul>
<br />
When the demand increases, the curve shifts to the right.
When the demand decreases, the curve shifts to the left.
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Supply</span>
<br><br />
<span id="hlight-y">Supply</span> is the amount of a product available in the market at a certain production quantity and selling price.
The <b>Law of Supply</b> states that (keeping all other things equal) as the price falls, the quantity supplied falls.
As the price rises, the quantity supplied rises. This is a direct relationship which can be seen in the graph below
that is usually used to represent the market supply.
<br>

<br />
Changes in supply:
<br>
<ul class="custom" id="hyphen">
    <li>A change in quantity supplied results in a different price along the same curve</li>
    <li>A change in market supply results in the same price on a different curve</li>
</ul>
<br />
<img class="img" src="images/supply-curve.png">
<br><br />
Supply is influenced by various <span id="hlight-b">determinants</span>:
<br>
<ul class="custom" id="open-circle">
    <li>Resource prices</li>
    <li>Technology</li>
    <li>Taxes and subsidies</li>
    <li>Prices of other goods</li>
    <li>Producer expectations</li>
    <li>Number of suppliers</li>
</ul>
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Markets</span>
<br><br />
<span id="hlight-b">Market equilibrium</span> occurs where the demand curve and the supply curve intersect.
This is where there is no surplus or shortage. When equlibrium is not met, there is a temporary shortage,
where demand is greater than supply, or surplus, where supply is greater than demand.
<br />
The <span id="hlight-g">rationing function of prices</span> is the ability of competitive forces of demand and supply
to establish a price of equilibrium.
<br>
<img class="img" src="images/market-curves.png">
<br />
Shifts in each curve will cause the equilibrium to shift as well.
<br><br />
A price ceiling is a price set (theoretically) below the equlibrium price that cannot be passed from below.
A price floor is a price set (theoretically) above the equilibrium price that cannot be passed from below.
There are limits set by the government that many economists argue inhibit the rationing function of prices and distort
the allocation of resources. However, these are <i>meant</i> to assist in the protection of the rights of the people,
either for the benefit of the company or the benefit of the consumers.
