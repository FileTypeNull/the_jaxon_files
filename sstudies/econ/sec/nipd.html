<span id="second-header">The Consumption Schedule</span>
<br><br />
<img src="images/consumption-schedule.png" class="img">
<br />
The consumption schedule reflects the direct consumption-disposabe income relationship.
In the aggregate, households increase their spending as their disposable income rises and
spend a larger proportion of a small disposable income than of a large disposable income.
<br />
The 45 degree line Z is the reference line. It is equidistant from consumption and disposable income,
so the distance between it and the real consumption line, C, represents total savings. This means that
S = DI - C.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Propensities</span>
<br><br />
The fraction of total income that is consumed is the average propensity to
consume, or APC. Essentially, APC = consumption &divide; income.
The fracton of total income that is saved is the average propensity to
save, or APS. Essentially, APS = saving &divide; income. Note that APC + APS should always equal 1.
This is because C + S = DI, so dividing everything by DI would create: APC + APS = 1.
<br />
The same as before, we also have marginal propensities. MPC = &Delta;C &divide; &Delta;DI, MPS =
&Delta;S &divide; &Delta;DI.
<br><br />
The reason why our marginal propensities add up to 1 as well (MPC + MPS = 1) is because there are only two options
for utilizing income: saving or consumption. Therefore, it will always add up to 1.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Nonincome Determinants of Consumption and Saving</span>
<br><br />
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li>
        Wealth: the amount that households spend and save from current income depends on the wealth
        they have accumulated. Wealth refers to the value of real and financial assets. When wealth is boosted,
        households will increase their spending and reduce spending.
    </li>
    <li>
        Expectations: expectations might affect spending and consumption (i.e. expecting higher prices tomorrow
        causes higher consumption and less spending today).
    </li>
    <li>
        Real Interest Rates: when real interest rates decrease, households will be more likely
        to consume rather than spend
    </li>
    <li>
        Household Debt: household debt as a percentage of DI is held constant,
        but when spenders as a group increase their debt, they can increase current consumption.
    </li>
    <li>
        Taxation: high taxes will shift both the consumption and saving schedules downward because
        they are paid at the expensive of both saving and consumption.
    </li>
</ul>
<br><br />
Note that these are also the deterinants of aggregate demand, which is derived from the consumer spending schedule.
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Interest-Rate-Investment Relationship</span>
<br><br />
Interest is the cost of borrowing from the money supply. Investment spending
is influenced by the expected rate of return and interest rates, where investment
consists of expenditures on new plants, capital equipment, machinery, inventories, etc.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Expected Rate of Return</span>
<br><br />
Investment spending is driven by the motive that certain spending will return profits
in the future. Our expected rate of return <i>r</i> is given by the difference in net expected revenue
and cost divided by the cost of investment. Say an item costs $1,000 and is expected to return revenue
of $1,100. This means our net profit is $100 ($1,100 - $1,000), so <i>r</i> = $100/$1,000 = 0.1 or 10%.
<br />
Real interest rates also determine investment spending, because if the interest is greater than the expected rate of return,
then the investment will not be profitable.
<br>

<br />
The investment demand curve is affected by acquisition, maintenance, and operating costs, business taxes,
technological change, stock of capital goods, and expectations.
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">The Multiplier Effect</span>
<br><br />
The final impact of an initial change in spending can be calculated using the spending multiplier. The size of
the final impact of an initial change in spending on GDP is affected by the amount of additional spending that results
when households receive additional income, called the marginal propensity to consume, or MPC.
<br>
We define the expenditures multiplier as the inverse of the marginal propensity to save, or 1/MPS.
If you are given MPC, then we know MPS = 1 - MPC, so MPS is easily determinable. The relationship between
the tax multiplier and the expensitures multiplier is that their sum must equal 1. This is because the tax multiplier
is (MPS - 1) / MPS, or -MPC / MPS. This is just 1 - 1/MSP. Therefore, the tax multiplier is 1 minus the expenditures
multiplier (also sometimes refered to as the spending multiplier).
<br><br />
Another way of looking at the multiplier is that it is equal to the change in real GDP over the initial change in spending.
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Aggregate Supply and Demand</span>
<br><br />
Aggregate supply and demand are demand and supply at the macroeconomic level.
Aggregate supply is affected by cost of input and productivity, and aggregate demand
is shifted by the expenditure effect of GDP: consumption, government spending, investment, and net exports.
Note that long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) is vertical and does not shift unless there is a shift in PPC or a continual
change in input cost or productivity.
<br />
When short-run equilibrium is to the left of the LRAS curve, then there is a recessionary gap since actual employment at
the short-run equilibrium is less than that at the LRAS curve. This is true because real GDP and employment are directly related,
as opposed to unemployment and real output/GDP. If the LRAS curve is to the left of short-run equilibrium, there is an
inflationary gap since actual employment is greater than full employment.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Slopes of the Curves</span>
<br><br />
The aggregate demand curve slopes downwards for multiple reasons.
<br />
When we draw
an aggregate demand curve, we assume the money supply is fixed. Therefore, when the price level rises, the
real interest rate increases and discourages consumer spending or investment. As a result, the real GDP decreases.
This also causes a greater demand for money, but since there is a fixed money supply, the amount of output produced
given a greater demand of money decreases; therefore, it causes the real GDP to decrease. This is the interest-rate 
<br />
The real-balances effect says that a higher price level reduces the real value or purchasing power of the public's
accumulated savings, therefore discouraging consumption and decreasing real GDP.
<br />
When the U.S. price level increases relative to foreign levels, foreigners buy fewer U.S. goods and therefore
net exports decrease. As a result, real GDP lowers. This is known as the foreign prices effect.
<br />
The wealth effect depicts how as real wages increase due to a decrease in price level, consumption increases and therefore
increases real GDP.
<br><br />
The reason the SRAS curve slopes upward is because of the existence of sticky and flexible prices. Sticky prices refer to
fixed prices that do not change to meet inflation or price level and flexible prices do. The combination of these two
result in the slope of the SRAS curve. Note that immediate-short-run aggregate supply is horizontal.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Inflation</span>
<br><br />
There are two types of inflation: cost-push and demand-pull. Cost-push is caused by a leftward shift in SRAS (short-run aggregate supply).
This is also known as stagflation because it stagnates the economy (output decreases) and increases inflation (price level rises). Cost-push
is adjusted by the fact that since price levels increased, government can, for example, decrease corporate taxes to bring it back to equilibrium.
Demand-pull is caused when aggregate demand increases. To meet this change, aggregate supply decreases to meet it. This helps bring
the short-run equilibrium back to the long-run equilibrium position. As a result, after both of these, the LRAS curve doesn't shift.
