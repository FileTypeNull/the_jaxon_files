<span id="second-header">The Demand for Resources</span>
<br><br />
Firms need resources in order to produce products. They meet the households at
the factor market (which is not a real place, like the black market) and pay them for
these resources. The demand for resources is a <i>derived demand</i>, derived from the products
that they help produce. The demand for a product influences the demand of the
resources used to produce said product.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Marginal Revenue Product</span>
<br><br />
The strength of the demand for any resource will depend on the
productivity of the resource and the market value of the good or service it helps
to produce. This is just a more definitional version of the statements I made
before. Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) is defined as the change in total revenue
resulting from the use of each additional unit of a resource. In a mathematical sense,
this means that MRP = &Delta;TR &divide; &Delta;Q<sub>r</sub>, where TR is the total
revenue and Q<sub>r</sub> is the resource quantity.
<br><br />
The rule for employing resources is when MRP = MRC, where MRC is the marginal resource cost.
The marginal resource cost is the amount that each additional unit of a resource adds to the firm's
total (resource) cost. Mathematically, MRC = &Delta;TC<sub>r</sub> &divide; &Delta;Q<sub>r</sub>.
<br><br />
Know that resource demand is the same as the MRP in a competitive product market.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Optimal Combination of Resources</span>
<br><br />
Firms must answer two questions:
<ol>
    <li>What combination of resources will minimize costs at a specific level of output?</li>
    <li>What combination of resources will maximize profit?</li>
</ol>
The <span id="hlight-b">least-cost combinaion of resources</span> is employed when the last
dollar spent on each resource yields the same marginal product. Confusing, huh? Here's a
formula:
<br>
    &emsp;MP<sub>r1</sub> &divide; P<sub>r1</sub> = MP<sub>r2</sub> &divide; P<sub>r2</sub> = &hellip;
<br><br />
The <span id="hlight-b">profit-maximizing rule</span> for multiple resources is when the MRP is equal to the price
for each resource. Therefore, MRP &divide; P = 1.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Marginal Productivity Theory of Income Distribution</span>
<br><br />
In the <span id="hlight-g">marginal productivity theory of income distribution</span>, income gets distributed
accordingly to contribution of society's output. Therefore, income payments based on marginal revenue product
seem to provide a fair and equitable distribution of society's income. There are several
critiques of this theory despite its seemingly fair principles. Such criticism include: inequality and market
imperfections.
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Wage Rates</span>
<br><br />
<span id="hlight-g">Wage</span> is the resource price of labor. As the quantity of labor increases, the real wage rate increases as well.
We can say that the wage rate represents the MRC.
A <span id="hlight-y">wage rate</span> is the price paid per unit of labor services, in this case an hour of work.
A <b>nominal wage</b> is the amount of money received per hour, day, or year. A <b>real wage</b> is the quantity
of goods and services a worker can obtain with nominal wages; real wages reveal the "purchasing power" of nominal wages
(McConnell & Brue 521).
<br><br />
When workers produce more quantity of product (meaning an increase in productivity), there will be more
real income available for distribution. There is a close relationship between output and compensation.
We can never infer that an increase in wage rates will lead to an increase in productivity, however.
A high correlation is not the same as true causation.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Purely Competitive Labor Market</span>
<br><br />
In a purely competitive market, individual firms and workers are wage takers, since neither can exert
any control over the market wage rate. For the firm, the wage rate vs quantity of labor model would look like this:
<br>

<br />
The equilibrium point is just an application of MRP = MRC.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Monopsony Model</span>
<br><br />
The difference between a perfectly competitive market and a monopsony is that the
<span id="hlight-g">monopsony</span> is a market in which a single employer of labor
has substantial hiring power. In this model, the MRC is geater than the wage rate.
This is because there must be uniform distribution of income. This is similar to the
model of nondiscriminatory monopoly.

<span id="third-header">Three Union Models</span>
<br><br />
Know the three union models:
<ul>
   <li>Demand-Enhancement Model</li>
   <li>Exclusive or Craft-Union Model</li>
   <li>Inclusive or Industrial Union Model</li>
</ul>
<span id="third-header">Bilateral Monopoly Model</span>
<br><br />
When you combine the monopsony model and the inclusive unionism model, you
get a <b>bilateral monopoly</b> because in its pure form there is a singe seller
and a single buyer.

<span id="third-header">Wage Differentials</span>
<br><br />
Wage differentials is the fact that hourly wage rates and annual salaries differ greatly among
occupations.
