<span id="third-header">Short-Run Curves</span>
<br><br />
Imagine that, in an industry, there is only one firm that produces any output for said industry.
From this point until the industry has reached its maximum capacity of firms, the industry is said to display short-run activity.
<br><br />
We know when a graph is depicted in the short-run because this is when the SRE (short-run equilibrium) is above the minimum point of ATC.
<br><br />
In the depiction of a firm, there are four curves. You have: MC, ATC, AVC, and MR.
The point where MR and MC intersect is the point where profit is maximized for that value of MR = P.
If this equilibrium point is above the ATC curve, then there is an economic profit.
If it is above the AVC curve but below the ATC curve, then there is an economic loss, but the firm should continue to produce.
If it is below the AVC curve, then the firm should shut down.
<br>
<img class="img" src="images/short-run.png">
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Long-Run Curves</span>
<br><br />
When the industry has reached the maximum number of firms, it is said to have reached the point of perfect competition.
There is no incentive to leave, but no new firms can join as there is no profit to be gained from producing in that industry.
This is essentially a shift in the supply curve to the right as the number of suppliers increases.
Hopefully we recall this from our determinants of supply.
<br><br />
In the depiction of the firm graph, the MC and MP will intersect at the minimum point of the ATC curve.
This is known as the “break-even” point, because there is no economic profit and only normal profit.
This is where the LRE (long-run equilibrium point) is. This happens because the long-run ATC curve
is the combination of the minimum points of multiple short-run ATC curves.

<span id="second-header">Cost Curves in a Pure Monopoly</span>
<br><br />
Let&apos;s remember the characteristics of a pure monopoly:
<ul>
    <li>Single seller &ndash; a sole producer</li>
    <li>No close substitute &ndash; unique product</li>
    <li>Price maker &ndash; control over price</li>
    <li>
        Blocked entry &ndash; strong barriers that stop potential competition
        <ul>
            <li>Economis of scale</li>
            <li>Legal barriers: patent and licenses</li>
            <li>Ownership of essential resources</li>
            <li>Pricing</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Non-price competition &ndash; mostly PR or advertising the product</li>
</ul>
In a pure monopoly, the monopolist is the industry. This means there is no difference between the market demand for the industry
and the demand for the firm. Therefore, the demand curve is downward sloping. Since this is the case, the monopoly must have a marginal revenue
that is less than the price on the demand curve in order to increase sales.
<br>
<img class="img" src="images/monopoly-curve.jpg">
<br />
In the image above, the demand is elastic up until the MR curve reaches the Q-axis. Afterwards, the demand is inelastic.
In the area of elastic demand, the monopolist is the price controller.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Profit Maximization</span>
<br><br />
The output point of profit maximization is where MR = MC, like with pure competition. From that point, you draw a vertical line
up to the demand curve which will have the price point of profit maximization. This will be the point
of maximum profit. Refer to the following graph for the method as to finding the economic profit and total cost:
<br>
<img class="img" src="images/monopoly-profit.jpg">
<br />
As you can see, the profit/loss is found by finding the distance between the ATC curve and demand curve at the profit-maximizing output.
Then, take the area of the rectange formed with the P-axis. Just like pure competitions, monopolies can have an economic loss or even break-even
(no economic profit, solely normal profit).
<br />
Now, monopolies are not always going ot sell at the highest price. They want to sell at the price that maximizes their total profit.
Furthermore, the point at which the MC and D curves intersect is the socially-optimal price. This is why a pure competition is efficient
while a pure monopoly, since the MR is not equal to D, has deadweight loss and therefore is inefficient.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Economic Effects of Monopoly</span>
<br><br />
Disregarding outside factors, the consumers of a monopoly are generally less wealthy than the monopolists or investors of the monopoly.
A negative externality of monopolies, therefore, is that the income gap increases with product purchases.
A monopoly is also going to have very low economies of scale; it's going to achieve the lowest long-run average total cost. However,
this assumes that they are utilizing the best possible resources. X-inefficiency is the term that labels the fact that the actual cost
of production is greater than those outlined in the lowest-possible average total cost curve.
<br>
<img class="img" src="images/x-inefficiency.jpg">
<br />
<span id="third-header">Price Discrimination</span>
<br><br />
Monopolies will engage in price discrimination, which leads to different prices for different consumers or locations, as the
selling price is not always dependent on total cost. In order to be a stronger monopoly, you must meet the following conditions:
monopoly power, market segregation, and no resale.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Regulated Monopoly</span>
<br><br />
The socially-optimal price is the point at which P = MC. The fair return price is the point at which P = ATC.
Natural monopolies are traditionally subject to rate regulation, commonly by government. Sometimes at
these points of regulation, the monopoly "takes an L,"&mdash;they might be subject to economic loss.
<br>
<img class="img" src="images/monopoly-regulation.jpg">
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Monopolistic Competition</span>
<br><br />
The demand curve for the monopolistically competitive firm is highly
elastic. Take a monopolistic firm and make the demand curve more elastic but not
perfectly elastic. There's your monopolistic competition graph for the firm.
It's as simple as that.
<br>
<img class="img" src="images/monopolistic-comp.jpg">
<br />
Unlike a monopoly, however, monopolistic competition does have an industry separate from the firm because
there are multiple firms. This leads to a greater number of substitutes, and thus, the demand is more
elastic. As always, firms want to produce where MR = MC and sell at the price that corresponds to the
point of demand that meets the quantity of the point at MR = MC (same as monopoly).
<br />
It is still inefficient because there is deadweight loss. And the economic profit/loss is calculated
in exactly the same way.
<br><br />
This wasn't pointed out earlier, but if you take a look, the long-run demand curve seems to only intersect the LRATC
curve at one point. You could say that, in the long-run, demand is the derivative of ATC (<i>see</i> <a href="/math/cal/">Calculus</a>).
This applies to when normal profit exists. At the profit-maximizing output, the long-run demand should be tangent to a point
on the ATC curve. if ATC is modeled by the function <i>A</i>(<i>q</i>), then <i>A</i>'(<i>q</i><sub>LR</sub>) = &epsilon;<sub>D</sub>
(elasticity of demand).
<br />
When P > ATC, there is productive inefficiency. When P > MC, there is allocative inefficiency.
