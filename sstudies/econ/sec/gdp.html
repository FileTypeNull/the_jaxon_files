<span id="second-header">GDP</span>
<br><br />
<span id="hlight-y">GDP</span>, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of aggregate output for an economy's production.
It's a monetary measure, in units such as dollars. In the GDP,
we exclude financial transactions because nothing is produced in a transaction. Instead, it is a movement
of products within the market.
<br />
There are two approaches to GDP: the income approach and the expenditure approach.
The income approach has the count income derived from production. The expenditure approach is the count sum
of money spent buying the final goods.
<br><br />
GDP is only measured within the scope of <i>a single year</i>. Note that in order to make it as accurate
as possible, <span id="hlight-b">intermediate goods</span> are ignored. Intermediate goods are
goods and services that are purchased for resale or further processing or manufacturing. This is
opposed to <b>final goods</b>, which are goods and services that are purchased for final use by the consumer.
Nonproductive transactions, secondhand sales, and personal productivity do not contribute to production and therefore
are not included in GDP. An example of a nonproductive transaction is buying stock or bonds.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Expenditures Approach</span>
<br><br />
GDP = C(consumption) + I<sub>g</sub>(Gross Private Investment) + G(Government Spending) + X<sub>n</sub>(Net Exports)
<br />
Above is the equation for calculating GDP using the expenditures approach.
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Business Cycle</span>
<br><br />
The business cycle displays the rise and fall in production output of goods and services within an economy.

During the growth period, inflation increases and unemployment decreases.
During a recession, inflation decreases and unemployment increases.
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Unemployment</span>
<br><br />
<span id="hlight-y">Unemployment</span> is the state of not utilizing one's skills in the labor force despite being willing and/or able.
There is a difference between not being in the labor force and not being unemployed. If you are not currently looking for a job, despite being able,
then you are <b>not</b> unemployed; instead, you are just not counted as a member of the labor force.
The <i>unemployment rate</i> is the percentage of the workforce that is currently not being employed.
If we relate this back to PPC, unemployment causes inefficiency and therefore hinders the economy from being able to
produce along the frontier. The unemployment rate formula is as follows:
<br><br />
&emsp; <i>UR</i> = <i>n</i><sub>unemployed</sub> &divide; <i>n</i><sub>labor force</sub> &times; 100%
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Types of Unemployment</span>
<br><br />
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li>Frictional unemployment: includes people who are temporarily between jobs but are actively working or searching for work</li>
    <li>Cyclical unemployment: caused by the recesson phase of the business cycle</li>
    <li>Sructural unemployment: occurs due to changes in the structure of laborial demand</li>
</ul>
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Inflation</span>
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Types of Inflation</span>
<br><br />
Demand-Pull Inflation describes too many dollars chasing too few goods. It describes inflation on the demand-side. It shows how
aggregate demand outplaces aggregate supply.
<br />
Cost-Push Inflation occurs when overall prices increase due to increases in the cost of wages and other resources.
It includes substantial increases in the cost of important goods or servies where no suitable alternative is available.
