<span id="second-header">Money</span>
<br><br />
Money is a form of currency that is given a determined value for the purpose of transactions.
All societies have some form of currency in order to perform equivalent exchange. There are
requirements for money: it has some value, it is accepted universally, and it maintains the same meaning with time.
Money is effective because it is generally accepted, scarce, and portable. The three funtions
of money are: medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.
<br />
There is commodity money and fiat money. Commodity money is based on the material it was manufactured with.
Fiat money does not have an intrinsic value; instead, it is given a value dependent upon that which the government
deems.
<br><br />
In order to obtain money from objects, they need to be liquidated. <span id="hlight-g">Liquidity</span> is the availability
of value in the market. Cash has the most liquid value. For example, you need to liquidate (or increase the liquidity) of
gold in order to convert into something that can be used in commercial exchange.
<br />
The levels of liquidity are M1, M2, and M3. M1 has the most liquidity and M3 has the least.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Stocks and Bonds</span>
<br><br />
Stocks and bonds are certificates that are used for starting or expanding a company. Stocks include the purchase of a share in the
company. Bonds do not mean this. That is the difference between stocks and bonds.
<br />
The value of stocks and bonds change depending upon the capital value or success of the company.
<br><br />
When the Federal Reserve (or fed) purchases bonds, the price of bonds in the market will increase bond prices.
On the other hand, open market sales will lower the price of bonds.
<br><br />
<span id="second-header">Fractional Reserve System</span>
<br><br />
The fractional reserve system is the policy that is set for banks. When deposits are made, they are required
to take a certain percentage of money per deposit, known as the reserve requirement. The way of determining the
monetary expansion created by the fractional reserve system is: amount of deposit &divide; reserve requirment.
For example, if the amount of deposit is $1,000 and the reserve requirement is 10%, then the monetary expansion
will be $10,000 = $1,000 &divide; 0.1.

<br>

<br />
The <span id="hlight-y">money market</span> compares the money supply to the demand for money. In the money market,
the supply of money is perfectly inelastic. When the fed expands the money supply, the supply curve shifts to the right.
As a result, the quantity of money increases and the real interest rate decreases.
<br />
When the demand for money increases, the quantity of money stays the same due to the inelasticity of the money supply.
This makes sense because a shift in money demand should have no effect on the amount in the market. <span id="hlight-g">Open market
operations</span> can shift the money supply. Buying government bonds/securities increases the money supply and selling them decreases
the supply of money. As a result, this leads to a shift along the investment demand curve which in turn causes a shift in aggregate demand.
<br><br />
The fed can also decrease the reserve requirement to create expansionary policy. Lowering the reserve requirement increases
the amount of reserves and therefore increases the money supply. Another method of expansionary policy is lowering the discount rate, which
refers to the interest rate on loans given to banks from the federal reserve. Lowering the discount rate performs the same functionality as
lowering the reserve requirement.
<br><br />
The fed may want to expand the money supply to meet a recession and contract the money supply to meet inflation.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Open Market Operations</span>
<br><br />
We have already discussed the means by which the Federal Reserve can create expansionary or contractionary monetary policies using
open market operations. But let's discuss what open market operations even <i>are</i>. Open market operations consist of the
buying or selling of government bonds from/to commercial banks and the general public.
<br><br />
A key term in open market operations is the <span id="hlight-b">federal funds rate</span>. The Federal Reserve uses open market ops
to set a target for this value. The fed has no control over the rate itself, as it is the interest rate that banks charge one another
on overnight loans of reserves held at the Federal Reserve Banks.
<br><br />
<span id="third-header">Demand for Money</span>
<br><br />
Unlike the supply of money which is affected by monetary policy, fiscal policy is what influences the demand for money.
Fiscal policy is government actions such as controlling tax levels or changing the amount of government spending.

<span id="second-header">Loanable Funds Market</span>
<br>
<img class="img" src="images/loanable-funds.jpg">
<br />
The <span id="hlight-g">loanable funds market</span> represents the relationship between the demand and supply of money that can
be lent or borrowed. The downward sloping demand <i>D</i> indicates that businesses will borrow more at lower interest
rates. The upward sloping supply curve <i>S</i> reflects the idea that at higher interest rates, households will
defer more of their present consumption (save more), making more funds available for lending.
<br />
The loanable funds theory of interest explains the interest rate not in terms of the total supply of and demand
for money but, rather, in terms of the supply and demand for these loanable funds.
<br><br />
Anything that prompts households to save their money will result in greater saving, shifting the supply curve rightward.
For instance, if the government offers a tax exemption for interest earned on savings, the supply of loanable funds would increase.
<br />
On the demand side, anything that increases the rate of return on potential investments will increase the demand for loanable funds, such
as productivity, consumer demand, etc.
