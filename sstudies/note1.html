<br><br>
• The institutions that make public policy decisions for a society and collectively is known as a <b>government</b><br>• In the case of our own national government, these institutions are Congress, the president, and federal administrative agencies ("the bureaucracy")<br>• There are about 500,000 elected officials in the United States<br>• National governments throughout the world should perform the following functions:
<br><br>
- <b><i>Maintain a national defense.</i></b> A government protects its national sovereignty, usually by maintaining armed forces. In the nuclear age, some governments posses awesome power to make war through highly sophisticated weapons. The United States currently spends over $650 billion a year on national defense. Since September 11, 2001, the defense budget has been substantially increased in order to cope with the threat of terrorism on U.S. soil.
<br>
- <b><i>Provide public goods and services.</i></b> Governments in this country spend billions of dollars on schools, libraries, hospitals, highways, and many other public goods and services. These goods and services are of two types. Some are what is called <b>collective goods</b>; if they exist, by their very nature they cannot be denied. As the private sector would have no incentive to provided only by the government. Other public goods and services, such as college or medical care, can be provided to some individuals without being provided  to all; these are widely provided by the private sector as well as by government.
<br>
- <b><i>Preserve order.</i></b> Every government has some means of maintaining order. When people protest in large numbers, governments may resort to extreme measures to restore order. For example, the National Guard was called in to stop the looting and arson after rioting broke out in Los Angeles following the 1992 Rodney King verdict.
<br>
- <b><i>Socialize the young.</i></b> Government politically socialize the young—that is, instill in children knowledge of and pride in the nation and its political system and values. Most modern governments pay for education, and school curricula typically include a course on the theory and practice of the country's government. Rituals like the daily Pledge of Allegiance seek to foster patriotism and love of country.
<br>
- <b><i>Collect Taxes.</i></b> Approximately one out of every three dollars earned by American citizens goes to national, state, and local taxes—money that pays for the public goods and services the government provides.
<br><br>
• All these governmental tasks add up to weighty decisions that our political leaders must make. For example, how much should we spend on national defense as opposed to education? How high should taxes for Medicare and Social Security be?  We answer such questions through politics.
