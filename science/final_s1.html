<ol>
  <li>
    What characteristics are shared by all living things?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Cells, need for energy, response to environment, and reproduction and development
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Sequence the steps in the scientific method.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Observation, Question, Research, Hypothesis, Experiment, Analysis, Conclusion
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is the difference between an independent and dependent variable?
<br>
   <b>Answer</b>: On a graph, the independent variable is on the x-axis and the dependent variable is on the y-axis. The difference between these two variables is that the dependent variable is affected by a change in the independent variable.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Describe the importance of using controls in an experiment.
<br>
   <b>Answer</b>: A control group is a standard of comparison, which allows for better analysis and more realistic conclusions.
  </li>
</ol>
<span id="second-header">Ecology (Chapters 13 - 16)</span>
<ol>
  <li>
    Differentiate between organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, and biomes.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: An organism is an individual living thing. A population is a group of the same species that lives in one area. A community is a group of different species that live together in one area. An ecosystem includes all of the organisms as well as the abiotic factors. A biome is a major regional or global community of organisms and are usually characterized by its climate conditions and plant communities.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are biotic and abiotic factors within an ecosystem?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Biotic factors are living things such as plants and animals, while abiotic factors are nonliving things such as soil, weather, sunlight, etc.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are limiting factors on the growth of a population?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: A limiting factor is the the factor that has the greatest effect in keeping down the size of a population. There are two types: density-dependent (based on population) and density-independent (limit growth regardless of population).
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Evaluate the effects of community interactions on different populations.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Competition and predation are two types of community interactions. Competition is when two or more organisms fight for the same limited resources, while predation is when one animal preys on another.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Construct a food web for a given ecosystem and identify the niche of each organism.
<br> 
    <b>Answer</b>:<br><img id="eco" src="/images/food-web.jpg"><br>Grasses, carrots, and grains require sunlight and nutrient-rich soil. The consumers that eat other organisms require energy from those organisms as well as a stable environment.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Infer the effect of a change within a trophic level to other levels within the energy pyramid or a food web.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: If the apex predator were to disappear, the lower trophic level would reproduce out of control and would consume all of their food too quickly. This would cause that trophic level to also disappear. If the primary consumer were to disappear from the ecosystem, the secondary consumers would die, and the tertiary consumers that eat the secondary consumers would die, etc.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Illustrate the recycling of matter (biogeochemical cycles) in an ecosystem.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>:<br><img id="eco" src="/images/oxygen-cycle.png" title="Oxygen Cycle"><img id="eco" src="/images/carbon-cycle.png" title="Carbon Cycle"><img id="eco" src="/images/nitrogen-cycle.png" title="Nitrogen Cycle"><img id="eco" src="/images/phosphorus-cycle.png" title="Phosphorus Cycle">
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Analyze the transfer of energy and matter through an ecosystem.
<br>
   <b>Answer</b>: Energy starts with the sun and goes to the plants. The plants convert this energy into 10% of the original energy, which is then passed into primary consumers. The primary consumers then pass 1% of the original energy to the secondary consumers. The secondary consumers pass 0.1% of the original energy to the tertiary consumers. The energy that is "lost" is really just a different form of energy from the original chemical energy.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Evaluate the effects of human activity on the environment.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Humans have destroyed the environment and caused many animals to go extinct. We have even endangered ourselves with our carelessness. Some things that humans have done to the environment include: pollution, global warming, acid rain, depletion of the ozone layer, and biomagnification.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is the difference between primary and secondary succession?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Primary succession is the establishment and development of an ecosystem in an area that was previously uninhabited. The first organisms to live in a previously uninhabited area are called pioneer species. Secondary succession is the reestablishment of a damaged ecosystem in an area where soil was left intact.

<ol>
  <li>
    Summarize the role of enzymes within an organism.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: An enzyme is a protein that catalyzes chemical reactions within an organism.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Describe the lock-and-key structure of enzymes and their substrates.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Enzymes bring substrate molecules close together. Enzymes also decrease activation energy. When substrates bind to the enzyme's active site, the bonds between these molecules become strained. This causes the bonds to become weaker.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are the four major macromolecules?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins, Nucleic Acids
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Relate the properties of water to the solubility of organic molecules.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Water is a polar molecule and has three major properties: high specific heat, cohesion, and adhesion. Having these properties makes water the universal solvent.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Differentiate between cohesion and adhesion.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Cohesion is the attraction of molecules in a substance while adhesion is the attraction of molecules in different substances
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is the difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Eukaryotes have membrane-bound organelles and can be multicellular, while prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles and are single-celled.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Differentiate between plant cells and animal cells.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Plant cells have chloroplasts, one large vacuole, and a cell wall. Animal cells have multiple small vacuoles and lysosomes.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What happens to enzymes when there is a change in pH or temperature?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>:If the area enzymes are in is relatively cold, they will catalyze reactions slower. However, if the temperature is hot, the enzymes will denature and cannot catalyze reactions anymore.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are the reactants and products in photosynthesis and cellular respiration?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Photosynthesis: 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + sunlight &#8594; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub>
  </li>
</ol>
<span id="second-header">Cell Growth and Division (Chapter 5)</span>
<ol>
  <li>
    Describe the major events of interphase.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: G<sub>1</sub> is also known as Gap One. In Gap One, the cell performs its normal functions as well as duplicate every organelle. In S phase, also known as Synthesis, DNA is duplicated. In G<sub>2</sub>, the cell carries out its everyday activities, condenses chromatin into chromosomes, and makes sure that DNA is not copied incorrectly before M phase starts.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Explain the importance of checkpoints during G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: If DNA is copied incorrectly or the cell is not ready to start dividing, the cell could mutate or become malignant.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Describe the major events of prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: In prophase, the nuclear membrane starts to dissolve and centrioles begin to move to opposite sides of the cell. In metaphase, the chromosomes line up together as the spindle-fibers start to connect to the centromere. In anaphase, the sister chromatids separate. In telophase, the nuclear membrane begins to reappear on both ends and the cell membrane pinches inwards. In cytokinesis, the cytoplasm splits and we are left with two daughter cells.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is the difference between chromatin and chromosomes?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Chromatin is uncoiled DNA while a chromosome is supercoiled DNA.
  </li>
</ol>
<span id="second-header">Genetics (Chapters 6 - 8)</span>
<ol>
  <li>
    What are the DNA base pairing rules?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: The purines (Adenine and Guanine) pair with the pyrimidines (Thymine and Cyitosine). Adenine [A] always pairs with Thymine [T], and Guanine [G] always pairs with Cytosine [C].
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is the central dogma of molecular biology?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: The central dogma is the order in which information is carried (DNA &#8594; RNA &#8594; protein)
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    How do RNA and DNA differ?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: RNA has Uracil [U] instead of Thymine, has a single-helix instead of a double-helix, and has ribose sugar instead of deoxyribose.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is translation?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Translation is the process in which mRNA is translated into tRNA.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    How are codons, anticodons, and amino acids related?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Codons are on mRNA and are translated into anticodons in tRNA. The tRNA goes into the cytoplasm and picks up the amino acids that correspond to the correct codon.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are the different types of mutations?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Substitution, insertion, deletion
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Compare and contrast mitosis from meiosis.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Meiosis replicates once and divides twice and creates gametes while mitosis occurs in somatic cells.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    How does gametogenesis and fertilization help maintain chromosome number?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: In gametogenesis, gametes are formed. Gametes have 23 chromosomes so that, in fertilization, the zygote has 46 chromosomes instead of 92.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    How does meiosis contribute to genetic variability?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: During gametogenesis, chromosomes cross-over, which means genetic code is changed. This makes every gamete unique.
