<b>1</b>. What distinguishes one <span id="highlight">element</span> from another?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Different elements have a different atom type that makes up the substance.
<br><br>
<b>2</b>. Describe the formation of an <span id="highlight">ionic compound</span>.
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: An ionic compound is formed through the creation of ionic bonds. Ionic bonds are formed when atoms of opposite charges (ions) are forced together by the electrical force between those ions.
<br><br>
<b>3</b>. What is the difference between an <span id="highlight">ionic bond</span> and a <span id="highlight">covalent bond</span>?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Ionic bonds are formed when atoms of opposite charges (ions) are forced together by the electrical force between those ions. Covalent bonds are formed when two or more atoms share electrons.
<br><br>
<b>4</b>. How does a <span id="highlight">molecule</span> differ from an <span id="highlight">atom</span>?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Molecules are two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds.
<br><br>
<b>5</b>. Explain why a hydrogen atom can become either an <span id="highlight">ion</span> or a part of a molecule.
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Hydrogen can easily bond with atoms to share its electrons, due to the fact that it only has one total electron. However, it can also bond ionically because it has one valence electron and can lose it just as easily. Basically, it can both gain and lose one electron.
<br><br>
<b>6</b>. A sodium atom has one outer electron, and a carbon atom has four outer electrons. How might this difference be related to the types of compounds formed by atoms of these two elements?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: There would have to be four sodium atoms in order to properly bond with the carbon atom.
