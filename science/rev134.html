<b>1</b>. Why are <span id="highlight" onclick="high1();">food chain</span>s especially useful for describing the relationships of <span id="highlight" onclick="high2();">specialist</span>s?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Specialists have specific diets that include only one type of organism, which produces a simple food chain.
<br><br>
<b>2</b>. What happens to energy as it flows through a <span id="highlight" onclick="high3();">food web</span>?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: As energy flows through a food web, the amount of energy obtained by the next trophic level is 10% of the previous level.
<br><br>
<b>3</b>. Only a small amount of consumers are specialists. What danger does a specialist face that a generalist (opp. of a specialist) does not?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: A specialist's only source of energy can become extinct or go endangered, thus forcing the specialist's species to starve.
<br><br>
<b>4</b>. How might the stability of an ecosystem be affected if all of the decomposers were suddenly removed?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: There would be no way of returning nutrients to the Earth, thus causing the Earth's soil to be depleted of nutrients, causing plants to die. The death of the plants would cause the consumers to die as well, leaving Earth lifeless.
<br><br>
<b>5</b>. How might an oil spill in the ocean affect an aquatic food web? What might happen to the food web on land located near the spill? Explain your answers.
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: An oil spill could kill the fish in an ecosystem, or it might block the sunlight from view. If either of these happen, the food web would be thrown into whack, and eventually the entire system might disappear. The plants or animals on land nearby would drink that water and die from the oil in the water. This would cause that food web to disappear as well.
