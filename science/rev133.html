<b>1</b>. How does the stability of an ecosystem depend on its <span id="highlight" onclick="high1();">producers</span>?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: All ecosystems depend on producers, because they provide the basis for the ecosystem's energy. Even animals that eat meat rely on producers. This is because, in the energy pyramid, producers provide the energy for the first-class consumers, or herbivores, and the second-class consumers, or carnivores, gain about 10% of the energy from the herbivores, who gained 10% of the producers' energy. Thus, all energy in the energy pyramid comes from producers.
<br><br>
<b>2</b>. What are the two processes used by producers to obtain energy?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: A producer has the ability to create their own energy using either <span id="highlight" onclick="high2();">chemosynthesis</span>, use of chemicals to obtain energy, or photosynthesis, the use of sunlight to produce energy.
<br><br>
<b>3</b>. Few producers live deep below a lake's surface. Suggest an explanation for this pattern.
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: The reason why many plants don't live deep below a lake's surface is because lakes don't normally have chemical vents. Thus, making it hard for producers to find any sources of energy in the dark, deep waters of the lake.
<br><br>
<b>4</b>. Could producers survive without <span id="highlight" onclick="high3();">consumers</span>? Explain why or why not.
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Producers could not survive without consumers because there would be overgrowth. Overgrowth is when an insane amount of plants grow in a single area. This causes all energy and sources of nutrition to deplenish much quicker, thus killing all of the plants in the process.
<br><br>
<b>5</b>. How might chemosynthetic organisms help scientists to understand how life developed on Earth?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Chemosynthetic organisms live in environments that may be similar to those that existed on Earth billions of years ago when life was beginning to develop.  Studying these organisms enables us to create models of how life forms might have evolved on Earth.
