    Discuss the limitations of the Linnaean system of classification.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Linnaeus's system focused on physical attributes instead of molecular similarities. However, physical similarities are not always a result of species' being closely related.

    What does a cladogram show? What is the relationship between a derived character, a node, and a clade?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: A cladogram is an evolutionary tree that proposes how species may be related to each other through common ancestor. Derived characters, nodes, and clades are all on a cladogram.
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
      <li><b>Derived Character</b> &nbsp; Traits that can be used to find evolutionary relationships (represented by a hash mark on a cladogram)</li>
      <li><b>Node</b> &nbsp; Each place where the branch splits</li>
      <li><b>Clade</b> &nbsp; Group of organisms that share a certain trait</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    Look at the amino acid differences chart on pg 529. Answer the 3 questions in the "Transform Data" section.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>:
    <ol style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
      <li>
        Based on the equation for Percentage Difference, <span style="font-family: monospace;">(diff &divide; 104) &times; 100%</span>, find:
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
          <li>Humans vs. Tuna: <span style="font-family: monospace;">(21 &divide; 104) &times; 100% = 0.2019 &times; 100% = 20.19%</span></li>
          <li>Humans vs. Bullfrogs: <span style="font-family: monospace;">(18 &divide; 104) &times; 100% = 0.1731 &times; 100% = 17.31%</span></li>
          <li>Humans vs. Turtles: <span style="font-family: monospace;">(15 &divide; 104) &times; 100% = 0.1442 &times; 100% = 14.42%</span></li>
          <li>Humans vs. Whales: <span style="font-family: monospace;">(10 &divide; 104) &times; 100% = 0.0962 &times; 100% = 9.62%</span></li>
          <li>Humans vs. Rhesus Monkeys: <span style="font-family: monospace;">(1 &divide; 104) &times; 100% = 0.0096 &times; 100% = 0.96%</span></li>
          <li>Humans vs. Chimpanzees: <span style="font-family: monospace;">(0 &divide; 104) &times; 100% = 0 &times; 100% = 0%</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The lower the amino acid percentage difference, the more closely related the two species</li>
      <li>Percentage Similarity is <span style="font-family: monospace;">100% - % diff</span>; therefore, Humans &amp; Whales: <span style="font-family: monospace;">100% - 9.62% = 90.38%</span></li>

    Why are viruses not given a place in the Linnaean system of biological classification.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Viruses are not given a place in the Linnaean system of classification because they are not living things. They have some key characteristics that living things do, but viruses cannot reproduce on their own. They also don't grow and develop, nor do they use nutrients and energy to survive.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Briefly describe the difference between the lytic and lysogenic cycles of viruses. Also, state how viral reproduction differs from bacterial reproduction.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: A lytic infection results in the lysis, or breaking apart, of the host cell and release of new viral particles. Lysogenic infections, however, do not destroy the host cell. A virus needs a host cell in order to reproduce, but a bacterium can reproduce asexually on its own.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What problems can occur by taking antibiotics when they are not needed and when are they prescribed?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Doctors prescribe antibiotics when the disease is caused by a bacterium. When a doctor doesn't prescribe antibiotics, it usually means that the pathogen is a virus instead of a bacterium. If you take an antibiotic when it is not needed, it could kill necessary/helpful bacteria in your body. Or, it could make the bacteria in your body resistant to the drug, thus creating a new bacterium that cannot be killed by antibiotics.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Explain how vaccines were discovered and how that knowledge is used today to combat viral infections.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: A vaccine is a substance that stimulates the body's own immune response against invasion by microbes. Vaccines are used instead of antiviral medicines because it is much harder to combat viruses than it is to combat bacteria.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are some differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles, such as a nucleus containing double-stranded DNA. Instead, their DNA is in the form of a circle and is surrounded by the cytoplasm. They also might have plasmids, which are tiny, circular pieces of DNA. Most prokaryotes can move on their own. The use external parts, such as cilia or flagella. They also have parts called, pili, which are structures that allow bacteria to stick to surfaces. They also have a plasma membrane and, normally, a cell wall.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    How can bacteria become resistant to certain antibiotics?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: If all of the bacteria are not killed or the antibiotics are not used properly, then the remaining bacteria can mutate and become resistant to that certain antibiotic.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What type of bacterial reproduction results in two genetically different bacteria?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Conjugation is the process by which one bacterium transfers genetic material to another bacterium by means of a cytoplasmic bridge. This allows bacteria to become genetically different more quickly than if they rely on random mutation.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are some characteristics of the different types of protists and why aren't they classified as animal, plant, or fungus?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Protists, all though share many characteristics with the other Eukaryotes, usually lack one or more traits that would place them into these kingdoms. Animal-like protists are heterotrophs, but are single-celled. Plant-like protists produce their own food through photosynthesis, but do not have leaves, stems, or roots and can also be single-celled. Fungus-like protists decompose dead organisms, but they can move during their life cycle.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Name and describe 3 types of structures that help protists move.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Protozoa can move with flagella, pseudopods (false feet), or cilia. Flagella are tail-like strands that allow the protist to swim. Euglena (1 flagellum) and Volvox (2 flagella) have flagella. Pseudopods are temporary extensions of cytoplasm and plasma membrane that allows protozoa to move. Most protozoa that use pseudopods also go through phagocytosis, which is the process of ingestion by means of surrounding the food, such as Amoebas. Cilia are tiny hairs that allow protists to glide across surfaces. Paramecium, Stentor, and Spirogyra use cilia.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Apart from primitive fungi, what are the other 3 groups of fungi and what characteristics determine how they are grouped?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: The other types of fungi are sac fungi, bread molds, and club fungi. All sac fungi form a sac, called an ascus, that contains spores for reproduction. Bread molds get food by decomposing matter and form a symbiotic relationship with plants called mycorrhizae. Club fungi get their name because their fruiting bodies are club-shaped. This includes mushrooms. The 3 types of fungi all reproduce by spores, but the structure containing the spores varies. In a club fungus, the reproductive feature is basidia. In a bread mold, they reproductive feature is a zygospore. In a sac fungus, the reproductive feature is asci.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Why can mushrooms not be completely killed if you kick them over or pluck them?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: The actual hyphae (or strand of fungus) is in the ground.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Explain the differences between fungi and plants regarding their mode of nutrition, the structure of their bodies, and the components of their cell walls.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Plants contain chlorophyll and photosynthesize, while fungi do not have chlorophyll and get energy by absorbing it from their environment. Plants also have roots, leaves, and stems, but fungi do not. A plant's cell wall is made up of cellulose, while a fungal cell wall is made up of chitin.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Explain mycorrhizae.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Mycorrhizae are mutualistic associations between plant roots and soil fungi. Mycorrhizae form when the hyphae of a fungus colonize the roots of a nearby plant. This relationship allows plants to gain access to nutrients and water much quicker, and the fungus receives sugars from the plant.
