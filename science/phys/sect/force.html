What is a <span id="hlight-y">force</span>?
A force is something that does work on an object, causing it to accelerate in a certain
direction as forces are <i>vectors</i> (<i>see</i> <a href="/math/precal/">Precalculus</a>).
An object can have multiple forces acting upon it, such as gravity or friction.
This is of importance when dealing with the acceleration of an object.
The <span id="hlight-b">net force</span>, &Sigma;<i>F</i>, is equal to
the mass of the object times the acceleration of that object; in other words,
&Sigma;<i>F</i> = <i>ma</i>. Why is the sum (&Sigma;) of all the forces on an object
considered the net acting force? It has to do with the nature of vectors,
as when you "add" vectors, it results in a new vector that we will call the "net" vector.

<span id="third-header">Friction</span>
<br><br />
Friction is a reactionary force, which means it only occurs in response to a certain motion.
<br />
There are two types of friction: <span id="hlight-b">static</span> and <span id="hlight-b">kinetic</span>.
In order for a force to do positive work (move an object in the direction of the applied force), the maximum
static friction, <span class="form"><i>f</i><sub>s-max</sub> = &mu;<sub>s</sub><i>F</i><sub>N</sub></span>, must be overcome.
Now, &mu;<sub>s</sub> is the coefficient of static friction that the object has with the surface.
This is a constant that has been determined through repeated experiment. After the static friction force has been
overcome by the applied force, the object experienced kinetic friction. Unlike static friction which is nothing
but a boundary for the working force, kinetic friction is the force applied by the rough, microscopic surfaces
as they slide across one another. This is seen in the figure below:

<br />
In the case where the coefficient of kinetic friction is &mu;<sub>k</sub> and the normal force, which is the force perpendicular
to the surface, is <i>F</i><sub>N</sub>, then <span class="form"><i>f</i><sub>k</sub> = &mu;<sub>k</sub><i>F</i><sub>N</sub></span>.
