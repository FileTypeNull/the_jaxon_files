<span id="third-header">Centripetal Acceleration</span>
<br><br />
Acceleration can occur in two situations: there is either a change in speed or a change in direction.
When there is a change in direction yet a constant speed that is tangential to the net force of the object,
the object is experiencing <span id="hlight-g">centripetal acceleration</span>, or <i>a<sub>c</sub></i>.
<br>
Know that: <span class="form"><i>a<sub>c</sub></i> = <sup><i>v</i>&sup2;</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>r</i></sub></span>
<br />
Imagine that a point is travelling along a circle at a constant rate, but is still accelerating due to
centripetal acceleration around some point:

<br />
This is similar to the motion of a planet around a circular orbit. This is because the only force affecting this object,
assuming no friction, is the force that points to the center of orbit. In a real-life application, imagine tying a ball to a rope
and swinging the rope around your head. The ball travels in a circular motion around the center: your head due to the tension force applied
by the rope on the ball.

<span id="third-header">Newton's Law of Gravitation</span>
<br><br />
This is an application of Universal Circular Motion, which defines the force of gravity on an object by a gravitational body.
This relationship is represented via the following equation:

    <i>F<sub>g</sub></i> = (<i>Gm</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub>) &divide; <i>d</i><sup>2</sup>
