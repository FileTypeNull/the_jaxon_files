<span id="hlight-g">Momentum</span> is an intertial quantity that can be measured
using the following equation:
<span class="form">
    <i>p</i> = <i>mv</i>
</span>
<br />
Because momentum is related to inertia, there is always a conservation of momentum
when objects collide.
<br><br />
<span id="hlight-b">Inertia</span>, in the physical sense,
is the resistance to change in motion. In this case, momentum is transferred
between objects in an isolated system (meaning there are no external forces).
This is known as the <i>Law of Conservation of Momentum</i>.
<br><br />
This conservation can modeled using the following equation:
<span class="form">
    <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> = <i>p<sub>f</sub></i>
</span>

An <b>elastic collision</b> is a collision in which there is no net loss of kinetic energy.
Thus, there is both a conservation of momentum and kinetic energy. In this case, if a ball
were to collide with a surface elastically, the ball should return with the same speed but in
the opposite direction. Since velocity is a vector, the momentum will have the same magnitude but opposite sign.
<br />
A new equation must be formulated for this collisions to follow the law of conservation of momentum.
Assuming that there is no change in mass (collisions often result in a loss of mass as thermal energy),
an elastic collision between two objects can be represented accordingly:
<br>
<span class="form">
    <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>v</i><sub>1<i>i</i></sub> + <i>m</i><sub>2</sub><i>v</i><sub>2<i>i</i></sub>
    =
    <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>v</i><sub>1<i>f</i></sub> + <i>m</i><sub>2</sub><i>v</i><sub>2<i>f</i></sub>
</span>
<br><br />
In other words, it is just the expanded version of
<span class="form">
    &Delta;<i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = &minus;&Delta;<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>
</span>
