Work can be derived by finding the area under a force-displacement curve.
Therefore, the formuala work is
<span class="form"><i>W</i> = <i>Fd</i>cos&theta;</span>. The cos&theta; comes
from finding the force vector in the direction of motion rather than the direction
of the force.
<br />
The energy we will be working with in mechanics is <span id="hlight-y">mechanical energy</span>,
which is the energy of movement. There are two types of mechanical energy: potential and kinetic.
Kinetic energy is the amount of energy an object has as it moves, represented by <i>K</i>.
Potential energy is the amount of energy an object has as it is stationary (essentially, the amount of stored energy it has that
it can use to move), represented by <i>U</i>. The following are the formulae:
<br>
&emsp;
<span class="form">
    <i>K</i> = &frac12;<i>mv</i><sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>
</span>
<br />
&emsp;
<span class="form">
    <i>U</i> = <i>mgh</i>
</span>
<br />
Due to the laws of the universe, there must be a conservation of all the energy in the universe is constant.
In mechanics, this is known as the law of conservation of mechanical energy, where mechanical energy is conserved
unless there is an external force doing negative work on the system (usually, friction). This law is represented by
the equation: <span class="form"><i>E</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>E</i><sub>f</sub></span>
<br />
Work can also be defined as the change in kinetic energy, or &Delta;<i>K</i>.

Take a look at the following roller coaster track:
<br>
<img id="expand" src="images/roller-coaster-1.png">
<br />
If there were a coaster cart of mass <i>M</i> on the top of the track at height <i>H</i>, what would
its speed be at the top of the loop if the radius of the loop is <i>R</i>? Assume friction
is negligible and the cart starts at rest.
<br />
The first thing we should do to answer this question is to calculate the initial
mechanical energy at the top of the track. Knowing that <i>E</i> (mechanical energy) is the
sum of kinetic energy and potential energy (<span class="form"><i>E</i> = <i>K</i> + <i>U</i></span>) and that
the cart starts at rest (so, <i>K</i> = 0), we know that the initial mechanical energy is equal to the
potential energy (<i>mgh</i>). The initial potential energy, and initial mechanical energy, of the cart is <i>MgH</i>.
<br />
The final mechanical energy is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy at the top of the loop
and the potential energy at the top of the loop. If we say that the bottom of the track is at height 0,
then the top of the loop is at height 2<i>R</i>. This means the cart's potential energy at this point is
2<i>mgR</i>. The kinetic energy at the top of the loop is &frac12;<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>. Since we
are trying to find the speed at the top of the loop, let's solve for <i>v</i>.
<br />
Our current conservation equation can be modeled as such:
<br>
&emsp;
<span class="form">
    <i>mgH</i> = 2<i>mgR</i> + &frac12;<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>
</span>
<br />
If we isolate the final kinetic energy:
<br>
&emsp;
<span class="form">
    &frac12;<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>mgH</i> &minus; 2<i>mgR</i>
</span>
<br />
Now, we solve for <i>v</i>:
<br>
&emsp;
<span class="form">
    <i>mv</i><sup>2</sup> = 2<i>mgH</i> &minus; 4<i>mgR</i>
    &rarr;
    <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> = 2<i>g</i>(<i>H</i> &minus; 2<i>R</i>)
    &rarr;
    <i>v</i> = &radic;(2<i>g</i>(<i>H</i> &minus; 2<i>R</i>))
</span>
<br />
We can say that <i>H</i> &minus; 2<i>R</i> is our overall change in height, &Delta;<i>h</i>.
Therefore, we can rewrite this as:
<span class="form">
    <i>v</i> = &radic;(2<i>g</i>&Delta;<i>h</i>).
</span>
<br><br />
The formula for power is:
<span class="form">
    <i>P</i> = <sup><i>W</i></sup>&frasl;<sub>&Delta;<i>t</i></sub>
