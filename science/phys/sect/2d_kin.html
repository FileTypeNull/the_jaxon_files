<br><br />
<u>Introduction</u>
<br />
If you already understand how to work with <i>projectile motion</i>, then that's great (<i>see</i> <a href="/math/precal/">Precalculus</a>);
but that will grant you no marks on the AP Physics Exam nor will you have any understanding of the mechanics behind the motion.
<br><br />
<u>Lesson</u>
<br />
2-D motion is described using the resultant of <i>vectors</i>, specifically an <i>x</i>-component and <i>y</i>-component of <i>velocity</i>.
When an object is thrown, it is propelled forward with a constant horizontal speed. This <i>x</i>-component can be represented by
the equation <span class="form">&Delta;<i>x</i> = <i>v<sub>x</sub>t</i></span>.
<br />
The vertical component is different, as it changes due to gravity (<i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = gsin<i>&theta;<sub>y</sub></i> [acceleration due to gravity] = -9.81 m/s&sup2;).
The acceleration due to gravity is normally negative because of the direction being 270&deg;, and sin270&deg; = -1.
<span class="form">&Delta;<i>y</i> = <i>v</i><sub>0<i>y</i></sub><i>t</i> + &frac12;<i>a<sub>y</sub>t</i>&sup2;</span>.
<br><br />
Now we have discovered our two-dimensional equations for the object.
Let's say we have the path of motion for a ball thrown horizontally from a cliff represented by the following graph:

<br />
Our vertical displacement, &Delta;<i>y</i>, is -9 meters and our horizontal displacement, &Delta;<i>x</i>, is 6 meters.
What is the original velocity of the ball?
Let's put all of the information we know about the problem into a table:
<br>

<br />
Our intiial vertical velocity is zero because the ball was thrown horizontally. To solve for time, let's input our <i>y</i>-values into the verticial eqaution:
<span class="form">-9 = 0 * <i>t</i> + &frac12;(-9.8)<i>t</i>&sup2;</span>, which simplies to
<span class="form">-9 = -4.9<i>t</i>&sup2;</span>.
Finally, if we solve for <i>t</i>, we get that the time it took for the ball to hit the ground was approximately 1.4 seconds.
<br><br />
We can input this value into our horizontal equation:
<span class="form">6 = <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>&times;1.4</span>, which means that <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> is approximately 4.3 meters per second.
Therefore, the answer to our question is that the ball was originally thrown at 4.3 m/s.

Here is another example of a problem involving two-dimensional motion:
