<b>1</b>. How are ATP and ADP related?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: They are both energy sources.
<br><br>
<b>2</b>. What types of molecules are broken down to make ATP? Which are most often broken down to make ATP?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Food molecules, but specifically glucose.
<br><br>
<b>3</b>. How are some organisms able to survive without sunlight and photosynthesis?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Some use chemical energy.
<br><br>
<b>4</b>. Describe how you do not get energy directly from the food that you eat?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Food needs to be digested and broken down into smaller parts. These smaller parts can be eventually broken down into ATP
<br><br>
<b>5</b>. How are the energy needs of plant cells similar to those of animal cells? How are they different?
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: Plants also need ATP, but they do not ingest or digest food.
<br><br>
<b>6</b>. A water molecule is added to an ATP molecule to break down ATP into ADP and a phosphate group. Write the chemical equation that represents this reaction.
<br>
<b>Answer</b>: H<sub>2</sub>O + C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>13</sub>P<sub>3</sub> &#8594; C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>18</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>14</sub>P<sub>3</sub>
