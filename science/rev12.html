<b>1</b>. Describe a biological <span id="highlight" onclick="high1();">system</span>.<br><b>Answer</b>: A biological system is where a species, or multiple species, work together to form an ecosystem.<br><br><b>2</b>. Give an example of how structure is related to living things.<br><b>Answer</b>: The structure of an ecosystem or structure of a living thing can greatly effect a species' ability to either reproduce or survive.<br><br><b>3</b>. Why is <span id="highlight" onclick="high2();">homeostasis</span> essential for living things?<br><b>Answer</b>: Internal factors are important for organisms, especially body temperature, which allows all functions to be completed.<br><br><b>4</b>. What is the relationship between <span id="highlight" onclick="high3();">adaptation</span> and natural selection?<br><b>Answer</b>: Adaptation is the advantage created by mutation, and natural selection chooses which adaptation of a species is more advantageous.<br><br><b>5</b>. How are structure and function related to adaptation?<br><b>Answer</b>: Here's an example: the structure of a robot can differ, but each design has one goal: to survive. This single goal can also change based on the differences between functions. A living organism holds the same basic context.<br><br><b>6</b>. How is the process of natural selection involved in <span id="highlight" onclick="high4();">evolution</span>?<br><b>Answer</b>: Evolution is what really plays a role in natural selection; it is the driving factor, actually. For example, humans evolved and became more and more complicated, sophisticated, and philosophical. These traits, along with higher intelligence, helped gain our species the stretch it needed to become one of the most successful organisms on the planet.
