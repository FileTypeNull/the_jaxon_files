<ol>
  <li>
    What is ecology?
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> Ecology is the study of interactions among living things, and between living things and their surroundings.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are the three main methods of ecological research? What are the advantages and disadvantages of lab/field experimentation?
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> Observation, experimentation, and modeling are the three main methods of ecological research. Experimentation has two types: lab and field. Lab experimentation allows for more control, but the artificial setting does not reflect the interactions that occur in nature. Field experimentation gives more accurate reflections of the interactions that occur in natural settings. However, it is more difficult to determine cause and effect due to the large amount of factors at work in nature.

<br>
  <li>
    Describe the 5 levels of ecological organization.
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> The levels are,
      <ul>
        <li><b>Organism</b> An organism is an individual living thing</li>
        <li><b>Population</b> A population is a group of the same species that lives in one area</li>
        <li><b>Community</b> A <span id="highlight">community</span> is a group of different species that live together in one area</li>
        <li><b>Ecosystem</b> An <span id="highlight">ecosystem</span> includes all of the organisms as well as climate, soil, water, rocks, and other nonliving things in a given area</li>
        <li><b>Biome</b> A <span id="highlight">biome</span> is a major regional or or global community of organisms, and are characterized by the climate conditions and plant communities that thrive there</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Differentiate between biotic and abiotic factors. Provide examples of each.
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> <span id="highlight">Biotic</span> factors are living things, such as plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. <span id="highlight">Abiotic</span> factors are nonliving things such as moisture, temperature, wind, sunlight, and soil.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is biodiversity? <span id="critical">What is the correlation between biodiversity and the health of an organism?</span>
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> Biodiversity is the the assortment, or variety, of living things in an ecosystem. The health of an organism relates to biodiversity because, depending on the biodiversity of an ecosystem, the organism thrives off of the natural resources produced by that certain biodiversity.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are keystone (indicator) species, and what do they tell you about the overall "health" of an ecosystem?
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> A <span id="highlight">keystone species</span> is a species with an unusually large effect on its ecosystem.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    <span id="critical">Explain how energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next trophic level in an energy pyramid. What happens to the "lost" energy, due to the fact that energy cannot actually be lost?</span>
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> Energy can be transferred from one organism to another by either consumption of the energy source (eating), or creating its own energy through chemosynthesis or photosynthesis. The energy is lost, however, due to the the energy consumption process being 90% inefficient. Thus, 90% of the starting energy is lost. But, it is not actually "lost". Instead, it is either converted or transformed into different types of energy.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    <span id="critical">Mathematically, explain why it is rare for ecosystems to have a 4<sup>th</sup> level consumers.</span>
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> 4<sup>th</sup> level consumers don't normally exist in ecosystems due to the fact that they would have to consume insanely large amounts of organisms in order to survive. This is because they only receive an average of 0.01% of the starting energy from the sun from its prey.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is symbiosis?
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> <span id="highlight">Symbiosis</span> is a close ecological relationship between two or more organisms of different species that live in direct contact with one another.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is population dispersion? What are the three types of population dispersion, and why would an organism be dispersed one way rather than another?
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> <span id="highlight">Population dispersion</span> is the way in which individuals of a population are spread in an area or volume. The three types are,
      <ul>
        <li><b>Clumped Dispersion</b> Individuals may live close together in groups in order to facilitate mating, gain protection, or access food resources</li>
        <li><b>Uniform Dispersion</b> Territoriality and intraspecies competition for limited resources lead to individuals living at specific distances from one another</li>
        <li><b>Random Dispersion</b> Individuals are spread randomly within an area or volume</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are the three types of reproductive strategy?
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> There are three types of reproductive strategies,
      <ul>
        <li><b>Type I</b> Type I survivorship represents a life history that is common among large mammals, including humans</li>
        <li><b>Type II</b> Organisms such as birds, small mammals, and some reptiles show a survivorship rate that is roughly equal at all ages of an organism's life</li>
        <li><b>Type III</b> Organisms with type III have a very high birth rate and also a very high infant mortality rate</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What is carrying capacity?
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> The <span id="highlight">carrying capacity</span> of an environment is the maximum number of individuals of a particular species that the environment can normally and consistently support.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are limiting factors?
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> The factor that has the greatest effect in keeping down the size of a population is called the <span id="highlight">limiting factor</span>.
  </li>
