<span id="second-header">Evolution through Natural Selection is Not Random=</span>
<ul>
  <li>The response of species to environmental challenges and opportunities is not random</li>
  <li id="third-header">Convergent Evolution=</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li>Different species often must adapt to similar environments</li>
    <li>Evolution toward similar characteristics in unrelated species is called <span id="hlight-y">convergent evolution</span></li>
    <li>Analogous structures, such as wings on birds and insects, are common examples of convergent evolution</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="third-header">Divergent Evolution=</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li>When closely related species evolve in different directions, they become increasingly different through <span id="hlight-y">divergent evolution</span></li>
  </ol>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Species Can Shape Each Other over Time=</span>
<ul>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Coevolution</span> is the process in which two or more species evolve in response to changes in each other</li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Speciation Often Occurs in Patterns=</span>
<ul>
  <li>Bursts of evolutionary activity are followed by long periods of stability</li>
    <li>This pattern is described by the theory of <span id="hlight-y">punctuated equilibrium</span>, which states that episodes of speciation occur suddenly in geologic time and are followed by long periods of little evolutionary change</li>
  <li>The diversification of one ancestral species into many descendent species is called <span id="hlight-y">adaptive radiation</span></li>
