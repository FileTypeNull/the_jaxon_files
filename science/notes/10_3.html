<span id="second-header">Several Key Insights Led to Darwin's Idea for Natural Selection=</span>
<ul>
  <li>The process by which humans change a species by breeding it for certain traits is called <span id="hlight-y">artificial selection</span></li>
  <li>In this process, humans make use of the genetic variation in plants and animals by acting as the selective agent</li>
  <li>In order for artificial&mdash;or natural&mdash;selection to occur, the trait must be heritable</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Heritability</span> is the ability of a trait to be passed down from one generation to the next</li>
  <li>In nature, the environment creates the selective pressure that determines if a trait is passed on or not</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Natural selection</span> is a mechanism by which individuals that have inherited beneficial adaptations produce more offspring on average than do other individuals</li>
  <li>In nature, the environment is the selective agent</li>
  <li><span id="third-header">Struggle for Survival=</span></li>
  <ol>
    <li>Malthus had proposed that resources for food, water, and shelter were natural limits to population growth</li>
    <li>A <span id="hlight-y">population</span> is all the individuals of a species that live in an area</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Natural Selection Explains How Evolution Can Occur=</span>
<ul>
  <li>Darwin and Wallace communicated with each other about their findings and research, and the next year, Darwin published his book <i>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</i></li>
  <li>There are four main principles to the theory of natural selection: variation, overproduction, adaptation, and descent with modification:</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li><b>Variation</b>&nbsp; The heritable differences, or variations, that exist in every population are the basis for natural selection. The differences among individuals result from differences in the genetic material of the organisms, whether inherited from a parent or resulting from genetic mutation.</li>
    <li><b>Overproduction</b>&nbsp; While having too many offspring raises the chance that some will survive, it also results in competition between offspring for resources</li>
    <li><b>Adaptation</b>&nbsp; Sometimes a certain variation allows an individual to survive better than other individuals it competes against in its environment. More successful individuals are "naturally selected" to live longer and to produce more offspring that share those adaptations for their environment.</li>
    <li><b>Decent with Modification</b>&nbsp; Over time, natural selection will result in species with adaptations that are well suited for survival and reproduction in the environment. More individuals will have the trait in every following generation, as long as the environmental conditions continue to remain beneficial for that trait.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>In biology, the term <span id="hlight-y">fitness</span> is a measure of the ability to survive and produce more offspring relative to other members of the population in a given environment</li>
