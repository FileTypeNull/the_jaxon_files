<ul>
  <li>In biology, <span id="hlight-y">variation</span> is the difference in physical traits of an individual from those of other individuals in the group to which it belongs.</li>
  <li>Variation can occur either among members of different species or among individuals of the same species</li>
  <li>The observations Darwin made in the Galapagos Islands led him to realize that species may somehow be able to adapt to its surroundings</li>
  <li>An <span id="hlight-y">adaptation</span> is a feature that allows an organism to better survive in its environment and can lead to genetic change in a population over time</li>

  <li>
    What accounts for the <span id="hlight-p">variation</span> Darwin observed among island species?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Variation can be caused by the differences in the biotic and abiotic features of the environment in which they live.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What did Darwin learn from the fossils that he observed on his voyage?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: The fossils that Darwin had studied on his voyage led him to believe that species can change over time. He saw that the fossils of the extinct organisms were found near similar organisms that were living in the area.
