<span id="second-header">Gene Flow is the Movement of Alleles Between Populations=</span>
<ul>
  <li>When an organism joins a new population and reproduces, its alleles become part of that population's gene pool</li>
  <li>At the same time, these alleles are removed from the gene pool of its former population</li>
  <li>The movement of alleles from one population to another is called <span id="hlight-y">gene flow</span></li>
  <li>For many animals, gene flow occurs when individuals move between populations</li>
  <li>Gene flow can occur in fungi and plant populations when spores or seeds are spread to new areas</li>
  <li>Gene flow increases the genetic variation of the receiving population</li>
  <li>Gene flow between neighboring populations keeps their gene pools similar</li>
  <li>However, the less gene flow that occurs between two populations, the more genetically different the two populations can become</li>
  <li>A lack of gene flow also increases the chance that the two populations will evolve into different species</li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Genetic Drift is a Change in Allele Frequencies Due to Chance=</span>
<ul>
  <li>Small populations are more likely to be affected by chance</li>
  <li>Due to chance alone, some alleles will likely decrease in frequency and become eliminated</li>
  <li>Other alleles will likely increase in frequency and become fixed</li>
  <li>These changes in allele frequencies that are due to chance are called <span id="hlight-y">genetic drift</span></li>
  <li>Genetic drift causes a loss of genetic diversity in a population</li>
  <li id="third-header">Bottleneck Effect=</li>
  <li>The <span id="hlight-y">bottleneck effect</span> is genetic drift that occurs after an event greatly reduces the size of a population</li>
  <li>The <span id="hlight-y">founder effect</span> is genetic drift that occurs after a small number of individuals colonize a new area</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Sexual selection</span> is selection in which certain traits enhance mating success; traits are, therefore, passed on to offspring</li>
