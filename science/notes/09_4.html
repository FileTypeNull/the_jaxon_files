<span id="second-header">Entire Organisms can be Cloned=</span>
<ul>
  <li>A <span id="hlight-y">clone</span> is a genetically identical copy of a gene or of an organism</li>
  <li>Clones can occur naturally</li>
  <li>Mammals are cloned through a technique called nuclear transfer</li>
  <ol>
    <li>First, an unfertilized egg is taken from an animal and is enucleated</li>
    <li>Then, the nucleus of the cell from the animal to be cloned is implanted into the egg</li>
    <li>The egg is stimulated and, if the procedure is successful, the egg will begin dividing</li>
    <li>After the embryo grows for a few days, it is transplanted into a female</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Cloning is also controversial because the success rate for cloning mammals is very low and the successful subjects are occasionally more susceptible to disease than the original</li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">New Genes can be Added to an Organism's DNA=</span>
<ul>
  <li>The changing of an organism's DNA to give the organism new traits is called <span id="hlight-y">genetic engineering</span></li>
  <li>Genetic engineering is based on the use of recombinant DNA technologies</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Recombinant DNA</span> is DNA that contains genes from more than one organism</li>
  <li>Recombinant DNA could be used to produce crop plants that make medicines and vitamins</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Plasmids</span> are closed loops of DNA that are separate from the bacterial chromosome and that replicate on their own within the cell</li>

</ul>
<span id="second-header">Genetic Engineering Produces Organisms with New Traits=</span>
<ul>
  <li>A <span id="hlight-y">transgenic</span> organism has one or more genes from another organism inserted into its genome</li>
  <li id="third-header">Genetic Engineering in Plants=</li>
  <ol>
    <li>The genetic engineering of plants is directly related to the genetic engineering of bacteria</li>
    <li>After the bacteria infect the plant, the new gene becomes a part of the plant's DNA and is expressed like any other gene</li>
    <li>This technique allowed scientists to give plants new traits, such as resistance to frost, diseases, and insects</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="third-header">Genetic Engineering in Animals=</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Transgenic animals are much harder to produce than plants</li>
    <li>Mice are often used as models for humans</li>
    <li>Some mice, known as <span id="hlight-y">gene knockout</span> mice, are made by disrupting the function of genes</li>
  </ol>
