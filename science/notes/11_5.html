<span id="second-header">The Isolation of Populations can Lead to Speciation=</span>
<ul>
  <li>If gene flow between two populations stops for any reason, the populations are said to be isolated</li>
  <li>As these populations adapt to their environments, their gene pools may change</li>
  <li>All of these changes add up over many generations</li>
  <li>With time, isolated populations become more and more genetically different</li>
  <li>Members of the two populations may also begin to look and behave differently from one another</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Reproductive isolation</span> occurs when members of different populations can no longer mate successfully with one another</li>
    <li>Sometimes members of the two populations are not physically able to mate with each other</li>
    <li>In other cases, they cannot produce offspring that survive and reproduce</li>
    <li>Reproductive isolation between populations is the final step of becoming separate species</li>
  <li>The rise of two or more species from one existing species is called <span id="hlight-y">speciation</span></li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Populations Can Become Isolated in Several Ways=</span>
<ul>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Behavioral isolation</span> is isolation caused by differences in courtship or mating behaviors</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Geographic isolation</span> involves physical barriers that divide a population into two or more groups</li>
    <li>These barriers can include rivers, mountains, and dried lakebeds</li>
  <li>Barriers can also involve timing</li>
    <li><span id="hlight-y">Temporal isolation</span> exists when timing prevents reproduction between populations</li>
      <li>Some members of a population may show signs of courtship at different times if there is a lot of competition for mates</li>
      <li>Reproductive periods may change to a different time of the year or a different part of the day</li>
      <li>These differences can lead to speciation</li>

  <li>
    How can <span id="hlight-p" title="When members of different populations can no longer mate successfully with one another">reproductive isolation</span> lead to <span id="hlight-p" title="The rise of two or more species from one existing species">speciation</span>?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Because species can no longer mate successfully, they are considered to be separate species. In reproductive isolation, the separation from one another for generations leads to genetic variation.  
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are three types of barriers that can lead to reproductive isolation?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Behavioral, Geographic, Temporal
