<span id="second-header">Natural Selection Acts on Distributions of Traits=</span>
<ul>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Normal distribution</span> is a type of distribution in which the frequency is highest near the mean value and decreases toward each extreme end of the range</li>
  <li>When these frequency values are graphed, the result is a bell-shaped curve</li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Natural Selection Can Change the Distribution of a Trait in One of Three Ways=</span>
<ul>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Microevolution</span> is the observable change in the allele frequencies of a population over time</li>
  <li>Microevolution occurs on a small scale within a single population</li>
  <li>Natural selection leads to microevolution</li>
  <li id="third-header">Directional Selection=</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> 
    <li>A type of selection that favors phenotypes at one extreme of a trait's range is called <span id="hlight-y">directional selection</span></li>
    <li>Directional selection causes a shift in a population's phenotypic distribution&mdash;an extreme phenotype that was once rare in a population becomes more common</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="third-header">Stabilizing Selection=</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li>During <span id="hlight-y">stabilizing selection</span>, the intermediate phenotype is favored and becomes more common in the population; it becomes stable at the intermediate phenotype rather than shifting toward one of the extremes</li>
    <li>Stabilizing selection increases the number of individuals with intermediate phenotypes</li>
    <li>In some populations, the extreme phenotypes may be lost altogether</li> 
  </ol>
  <li id="third-header">Disruptive Selection=</li>
  <ol>
    <li><span id="hlight-y">Disruptive selection</span> occurs when both extreme phenotypes are favored, while individuals with intermediate phenotypes are selected against by something in nature</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    In terms of phenotypes, describe what is meant by the phrase "distribution of traits."
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: The distribution of traits refers to the chance for a specific allele to be distributed throughout a population.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What are three ways in which natural selection can change a distribution of traits?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Stabilizing Selection, Disruptive Selection, Directional Selection
