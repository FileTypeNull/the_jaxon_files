<span id="second-header">Evidence for Evolution in Darwin's Time Came from Several Sources=</span>
<ul>
  <li>The most important and convincing support for evolution came from fossils, geography, embryology, and anatomy:</li>
  <li id="third-header">Fossils=</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li>Even before Darwin, scholars studying fossils knew that organisms changed over time</li>
    <li>Scientists who study fossils also think about its age, its location, and what the environment was like when the organism was alive</li>
    <li>In the late 1700s, geologists wondered why certain types of fossils were found in some layers of rock and not others</li>
    <li>Later studies suggest that the fossil organisms at the bottom, or older, layers were more primitive than those in the upper, or newer, layers</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="third-header">Geography=</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li><span id="hlight-y">Biogeography</span> is the study of the distribution of organisms around the world</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="third-header">Embryology=</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li>The embryos of vertebrates can be hard to tell apart</li>
    <li>The similar features of embryos in very different organisms suggest evolution from a distant common ancestor</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="third-header">Anatomy=</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
    <li><span id="hlight-y">Homologous structures</span> are features that are similar in structure but appear in different organisms and have different functions</li>
    <li>The most common examples of homologous structures are the forelimbs of tetrapod vertebrates</li>
    <li><span id="hlight-y">Analogous structures</span> are structures that perform a similar function but are not similar in origin</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

<p class="header">Questions</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Name the four sources of evidence for evolution upon which Darwin based his ideas on common descent
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Fossils, Geography, Embryology, Anatomy
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Why are <span id="hlight-p" title="Remnants of organs or structures that had a function in an early ancestor but are no longer useful">vestigial structures</span> considered critical evidence for evolution?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: It allows us to see that some things that organisms have now that are useless originally had a function, and we can see how and why evolution shaped that organism in that manner.
