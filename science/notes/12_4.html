  <li>Scientists have found evidence that photosynthetic life evolved more than 3.5 billion years ago, since that is the age of the oldest known fossils</li>
  <li>These fossils are of a group of marine <span id="hlight-y">cyanobacteria</span>, which are bacteria that can carry out photosynthesis</li>
  <li>Like all early life forms, each cyanobacterium was a single prokaryotic cell</li>
  <li>Some cyanobacteria live in colonies and form <i>stromatolites</i></li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Eukaryotic Cells May Have Evolved Through Endosymbiosis=</span>

  <li><span id="hlight-y">Endosymbiosis</span> is a relationship in which one organism lives within the body of another, and both benefit from the relationship</li>
