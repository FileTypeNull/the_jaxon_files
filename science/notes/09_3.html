<span id="second-header">A DNA Fingerprint is a Type of Restriction Map=</span>
<ul>
  <li>A <span id="hlight-y">DNA fingerprint</span> is a representation of parts of an individual's DNA that can be used to identify a person at the molecular level</li>
  <li>A DNA fingerprint is a specific type of restriction map</li>
  <li>The greatest differences in DNA among people are those found in regions of the genome that are not parts of genes</li>
  <li>DNA fingerprinting focuses on the noncoding regions of DNA, or DNA sequences outside of the genes</li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">DNA Fingerprinting is Used for Identification=</span>
<ul>
  <li>The specific nucleotide sequences that are repeated can be found in everyone</li>
  <li>From one person to another, the number of repeat sequences can differ greatly, even among brothers and sisters</li>
  <li id="third-header">DNA Fingerprints and Probability=</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Identification with DNA fingerprinting depends on probability</li>
    <li>Individual probabilities are multiplied by each other to find the total probability</li>
    <li>DNA fingerprinting compares at least five regions of the genome which makes patterns unique</li>
    <li>The more DNA that is studied, the less likely it becomes that two people share the same DNA fingerprint</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="third-header">Uses of DNA Fingerprinting=</li>
  <ol>
    <li>DNA fingerprints are often used in legal cases</li>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>Evidence can come from even the smallest of samples due to PCR</li>
      <li>Sometimes DNA fingerprints are used against a suspect, but other times they are used to prove someone's innocence</li>
    </ul>
    <li>DNA fingerprints can prove family relationships and are used to study biodiversity</li>
  </ol>

<p class="header">Questions</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    On what, in a person's DNA, is a <span id="hlight-p">DNA fingerprint</span> based?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: A person's DNA fingerprint is based on the part of the genome that does not contain genes.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Describe two ways in which DNA fingerprinting is used.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: DNA fingerprinting can be used to prove family relationships and prove someone's innocence.
