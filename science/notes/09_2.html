<span id="second-header">PCR Uses Polymerases to Copy DNA=</span>
<ul>
  <li>Scientists need to get a large enough sample of DNA to study and manipulate it</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</span> is a technique that produces millions&mdash;or even billions&mdash;of copies of a specific DNA sequence in just a few hours</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Kary Mullis invented PCR, and he decided that heat should be used to separate the DNA strands instead of enzymes</li>
    <li>PCR uses polymerases that come from bacteria which live in temperatures of up to 80&deg;C to copy the DNA strands</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">PCR is a Three-Step Process=</span>
<ul>
  <li>PCR uses four materials: a DNA template, DNA polymerases, artificial nucleotides, and two primers</li>
  <li>A <span id="hlight-y">primer</span> is a short segment of DNA that acts as the starting point for a new strand</li>
  <li>Primers are needed in PCR because DNA polymerases can add nucleotides to strands that have already been started, but cannot start the strand</li>
  <li>
    PCR has three main steps:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Separating:</b> The container with all of the reactants is heated to separate the double-stranded DNA into single strands</li>
      <li><b>Binding:</b> The container is cooled and the primers bind to their complementary DNA sequences</li>
      <li><b>Copying:</b> The container is heated again and the polymerases keep adding nucleotides until the sequence is complete
    </ol>
    This sequence is repeated multiple times until there is enough DNA for the scientists to observe (doubles every cycle)
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>
    Briefly describe the function of <span id="hlight-p">polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</span>.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: PCR's main function is to replicate DNA multiple times over so that scientists have enough to observe.
  </li>

    Summarize the cycle involved in the PCR process.
