<span id="second-header">Genetic Variation in a Population Increases the Chance that Some Individuals Will Survive=</span>
<ul>
  <li>Natural selection acts acts on different phenotypes in a population</li>
  <li>The greater the variation in phenotypes, the more likely it is that some individuals can survive in a changing environment</li>
  <li>Genetic variation is stored in a population's <span id="hlight-y">gene pool</span>&mdash;the combined alleles of all of the individuals in a population</li>
  <li>An <span id="hlight-y">allele frequency</span> is a measure of how common a certain allele is in the population</li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Genetic Variation Comes from Several Sources=</span>
<ul>
  <li>Genetic variation comes from two main sources: mutation and recombination</li>
<br>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Mutation</b>&nbsp; A mutation is a random change in the DNA of a gene. This change can form a new allele. Mutations in reproductive cells are passed on to offspring. This increases the genetic variation in the gene pool.</li>
<br>
    <li><b>Recombination</b>&nbsp; New allele combinations form in offspring through a process called recombination. Most recombination occurs during meiosis&mdash;the type of cell division needed for sexual reproduction. When gametes are made, each parent's alleles are arranged in different ways.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>
    Why does genetic variation increase the chance that some individuals in a population will survive?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Genetic variation can be caused due to random mutation or recombination, which may allow different animals to survive in different areas of a population.
