<span id="second-header">Early Scientists Proposed Ideas about Evolution=</span>
<ul>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Evolution</span> is the process of biological change by which descendants come to differ from their ancestors</li>
  <li><span id="third-header">Carolus Linnaeus=</span></li>
  <ol>
    <li>Linnaeus was a botanist in the 1700s who developed a classification system for all types of organisms known at the time</li>
    <li>Although he grouped organisms by their similarities, the system also reflects evolutionary relationships</li>
    <li>He proposed that, instead of being fixed and unchanging, some organisms might have been created through the crossing of species</li>
    <li>A <span id="hlight-y">species</span> is a group of organisms so similar to one another that they can reproduce and have fertile offspring</li>
  </ol>
  <li><span id="third-header">Georges Louis Leclerc de Buffon=</span></li>
  <ol>
    <li>Buffon was a French naturalist of the 1700s and claimed that all species came from a single, common ancestor</li>
    <li>He also argued that Earth was far older than 6,000 years old</li>
  </ol>
  <li><span id="third-header">Erasmus Darwin=</span></li>
  <ol>
    <li>Erasmus Darwin is the grandfather of Charles Darwin, who is considered the father of evolution</li>
    <li>He proposed that the all living things were descended from a common ancestor that more-complex forms of life arose from less-complex forms</li>
  </ol>
  <li><span id="third-header">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck=</span></li>
  <ol>
    <li>Lamarck proposed that all organisms evolved toward perfection and complexity</li>
    <li>Lamarck believed in the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

<span id="second-header">Theories of Geologic Change Set the Stage for Darwin's Theory=</span>
<ul>
  <li>French zoologist Georges Cuvier discovered <span id="hlight-y">fossils</span>, or traces of organisms that existed in the past, in each layer of rock</li>
  <li>He found that the fossils in the deepest layers were quite different from those in the upper layers, which were formed by more recent layers of sediment</li>
  <li>The theory of <span id="hlight-y">catastrophism</span> states that natural disasters such as floods and volcanic eruptions have been happened often during Earth's long history</li>
  <li>Cuvier argued that the appearance of new species in each rock layer resulted from other species' moving into the area from elsewhere after each catastrophic event</li>
  <li>James Hutton proposed that the changes he observed in landforms resulted from slow changes over a long period of time, a principle that became known as <span id="hlight-y">gradualism</span></li>
  <li>Lyell expanded Hutton's theory of gradualism into the theory of <span id="hlight-y">uniformitarianism</span>, which states that the geologic processes that shape Earth are uniform through time</li>
</ul>

<p class="header">Questions</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Briefly describe two ideas about <span id="hlight-p">evolution</span> that were proposed by scientists in the 18th century.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Buffon believed that different species had come from a common ancestor and Darwin's grandfather proposed that more-complex forms of life arose from less-complex forms of life.
  </li>
  <li>
    What ideas about Lyell's theory of <span id="hlight-p">uniformitarianism</span> were important for evolutionary theory?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: The aspect of Lyell's theory that is most important is that evolution occurs gradually throughout time at a constant rate.
