<span id="second-header">Scientists Use Several Techniques to Manipulate DNA=</span>
<ul>
  <li>By the 1950s, scientists had concluded that DNA was the genetic material</li>
  <li>Watson and Crick had determined the structure of DNA</li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Restriction Enzymes Cut DNA=</span>
<ul>
  <li>A whole chromosome is too large for scientists to study a particular gene, so they had to find a way to get smaller pieces of DNA</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Restriction enzymes</span> are enzymes that cut DNA molecules at specific nucleotide sequences</li>
  <li>The sequence of nucleotides that is identified and cut by a restriction enzyme is called a restriction site</li>
  <li>They are called 'restriction' enzymes because they 'restrict', or decrease, the risk of a virus on a bacterial cell</li>
  <li>Every restriction enzyme has a different restriction site and will cut the same DNA molecule in different ways</li>
  <li>Blunt ends are formed when restriction enzymes cut DNA straight across</li>
  <li>Sticky ends are formed from cuts that leave tails of free DNA bases on each side of the cut</li>
</ul>
<span id="second-header">Restriction Maps Show the Lengths of DNA Fragments=</span>
<ul>
  <li>In <span id="hlight-y">gel electrophoresis</span>, and electrical current is used to separate a mixture of DNA fragments from each other</li>
  <li>The length of a DNA fragment can be determined using gel electrophoresis</li>
  <li><span id="hlight-y">Restriction maps</span> show the lengths of DNA fragments between restriction sites in a strand of DNA</li>
  <li>Restriction maps can also be used to study gene mutations</li>
</ul>

<p class="header">Questions</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    List four different ways in which scientists can manipulate DNA.
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: PCR, gel electrophoresis, restriction enzymes, and restriction maps are all ways that scientists can manipulate DNA.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    What determines how DNA will be cut by a <span id="hlight-p">restriction enzymes</span>?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: DNA will be cut based on what restriction enzymes cut it and how many restriction sites it has.
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    How does <span id="hlight-p">gel electrophoresis</span> separate DNA fragments from each other?
<br>
    <b>Answer</b>: Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments from each other based on the lengths between restriction sites.
