<span id="second-header">Determining the Behavior of a Function</span>
<br><br />
You can determine a function&apos;s behavior by looking at its derivative.
If the value of <i>f</i> &apos;(<i>c</i>) is positive, then <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>) is increasing at
<i>x</i> = <i>c</i>. If <i>f</i> &apos;(<i>c</i>) is negative, then <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>) is decreasing
at <i>x</i> = <i>c</i>. If <i>f</i> &apos;(<i>c</i>) is zero, then <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>) has
a horizontal tangent line at <i>x</i> = <i>c</i>. If <i>f</i> &apos;(<i>c</i>) is undefined,
then <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>) has a vertical tangent line at <i>x</i> = <i>c</i>.
<br />
The critical points of a function, <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>), are the points where <i>f</i> &apos;(<i>x</i>) = 0
or <i>f</i> &apos;(<i>x</i>) is undefined. For instance, the critical points of
<i>y</i> = &frac13; <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> &minus; 4<i>x</i> are found using <i>y</i> &apos;, which is
<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> &minus; 4, so the values are <i>x</i><sub>crit</sub> = -2, 2 because those values make <i>y</i> &apos; = 0.
We can express the intervals of increase and decrease through a table:
<br><br />
<table class="interval">
  <tr>
    <th id="func"><i>f</i> &apos;</th>
    <td>(-&infin;, -2)</th>
    <td>(-2, 2)</th>
    <td>(2, &infin;)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="func"><i>x</i> &minus; 2</td>
    <td>&minus;</td>
    <td>&minus;</td>
    <td>&plus;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="func"><i>x</i> &plus; 2</td>
    <td>&minus;</td>
    <td>&plus;</td>
    <td>&plus;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="func">Inc/Dec:</td>
    <td>&uarr;</td>
    <td>&darr;</td>
    <td>&uarr;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br />
Because the function is also the same as (<i>x</i> + 2)(<i>x</i> &minus; 2), we can break down the function into two functions in the table.
Then, we multiply the signs together to get whether the function is increasing or decreasing on that interval.
This means the function is increasing on the interval(s) (-&infin;, -2) and (2, &infin;), and is decreasing on the interval (-2, 2).
Therefore, there is a relative maximum at <i>x</i> = -2 and a relative minimum at <i>x</i> = 2.
Finding extrema by interpreting an interval table for the first derivative is called the <span id="hlight-b">first derivative test</span>.
<br><br />
The second derivative can show the concavity of a function.
If <i>f</i> &apos;&apos;(<i>c</i>) is positive at <i>x</i> = <i>c</i>, then <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>) is concave up at <i>x</i> = <i>c</i>.
If <i>f</i> &apos;&apos;(<i>c</i>) is negative at <i>x</i> = <i>c</i>, then <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>) is concave down at <i>x</i> = <i>c</i>.
If <i>f</i> &apos;&apos;(<i>x</i>) = 0, then that defined value of <i>x</i> is an inflexion point on the graph of <i>f</i> (<i>x</i>), or a point where
the function changes concavity.
<br />
For the function <i>y</i> = &frac13; <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> &minus; 4<i>x</i>, the second derivative would be <i>y</i> &apos;&apos; = 2<i>x</i>.
This means our point of inflexion is <i>x</i><sub>inflex</sub> = 0.
Let&apos;s do the same thing we did with the first derivative and set up an interval table:
<br><br />
<table class="interval">
  <tr>
    <th id="func"><i>y</i> &apos;&apos;</th>
    <td>(-&infin;, 0)</td>
    <td>(0, &infin;)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="func">2<i>x</i></td>
    <td>&minus;</td>
    <td>&plus;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="func">CC:</td>
    <td>&darr;</td>
    <td>&uarr;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br><br />
This means the function is concave down on the interval (-&infin;, 0) and concave up on the interval (0, &infin;).
<br />
We can use the second derivative to find extrema as well using what is known as the <span id="hlight-b">second derivative test</span>.
Our first step is to take the critical points of <i>y</i> &apos;, which were -2 and 2, and plug them into the second derivative.
If the result is negative, the concavity at that point is down, so there is a maximum.
If the result is positive, the concavity at that point is up, so there is a minimum.
However, the second derivative test may fail if there are undefined points on the function.

<span id="second-header">Applications of Differentiation</span>
<br><br />
Using differentiation, we can solve a lot of complex problems by interpreting them as functions.
For instance, say we were given the following problem:
<br>
&emsp; &emsp; <b>Find two numbers whose sum is 20 and whose product is as large as possible</b>.
<br />
Such a problem is known as <span id="hlight-g">optimization</span>.
To solve it, we must set up two parameter functions.
These would be <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 20 and <i>xy</i> = max.
<br><br />
Below is an example of <span id="hlight-g">related rates</span>, which is another application of differentiation:
